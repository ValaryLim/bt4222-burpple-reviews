The staff just stood around talking amongst themselves. The 5 staff weren‚Äôt standing far from us and I‚Äôm sure we were in plain view. We waved them over and said they needed to reseat us. Only one person set up another table under shelters for us. We had to carry our food and drinks ourselves. Had to ask one of them for help and she took 1 plate of our food. After we got seated at a new table They brought back the plate of our left over roll and the plate is still covered in rain water! I couldn‚Äôt believe they didn‚Äôt bother to change the plate. We asked to speak with the manager and when the staff reluctantly went to ask and explain the situation, she didn‚Äôt bother coming over even though we stayed on for another 30 minutes.

278,casuarina-curry,Curry In A Platter,"A very curry-looking meal I had on a relaxing Monday night. My first time here and here's my take:
-Try the other things beside the pratas. I ordered a plain prata and it was way over-fried :( To the extent it was a bit hard.
-The murtabuk was pleasantly surprising. It was really good. And it has a lot of meat üëçüèª Go for that!
-The butter chicken was slightly below average with regards to the taste, but there was a lot of chicken inside despite the tiny bowl.
-Teh Aliya was üëçüèª

Thin crispy battered layer on the outside, soft succulent fish filet. 
Could visibly see that the battered layer had a few types of herbs in it which made it rather aromatic with each bite. 
Potato salad was alright ,not too soft or hard. Nothing too fancy 
Would not recommend to have egg salad with potato salad. Way too much mayo sauce in one meal.

670,jun-yuan-house-of-fish,I have been eyeing this stall at old airport road hawker centre for the longest time after it appeared in the news for helping an old man earn some money by delivering food around 1km radius around old airport.,"It took me 3 attempts before I could finally get my hands on this! First few times I was there after cycling before it opened at 11am.. the second time I reached at 8.45pm after evening cycling and they were already packing up to go home (though operation hours are till 9pm). This time round went during lunch and managed to try! (Though we tried to call the hp number a few times to pre order for self collection but the line was never picked up). This is the herbal seafood soup and it reminds me of OAR seafood soup! Both have two prawns, this use batang fish while the other uses dory fish. Both have pork balls but this stall's is much smaller than the other one. Overall I like both! go for this if you like the herbal taste in your soup!

The soup base for Chinese Spinach Seafood Soup with Wolfberries is boiled for 6 hours with pork and fish bones while soup broth for the Herbal Seafood Soup is mixed with stir fried prawn and the other seafood with dried fish. The former had a lighter more comforting homely taste while the latter had a richer and more flavourful taste integrated with the seafood and herbs; both soups were delicious and appealed to us in different ways.

Head down as early as possible to avoid dissapointment or call to book in advance. I reached down by 9.30am and only 3 types of tarts available at the moments. I consider myself lucky for the day. I am pretty sure it is a third of the price compared to those fancy artisan patisserie.

Freshly baked homebaked goodness by a pair of passionate and friendly couple. üë¥üëµDefinitely worth the calories and time to head over to support them. üÜôÔ∏èüÜôÔ∏è

Their crust taste like pineapple tart, really buttery.
Very delicious tarts!!üòãüòã Extremely generous amount of filling in each tarts. I am totally hooked on their tarts.

Orh Nee Tart‚úî‚úî ($1.20) - smooth, silky and natural fragrant of yam filling blended well with earthy ginkgo in the buttery crust.
Cheese Tart üßÄüßÄ($1.20) -the mixture of the acidity and richness of the cheesecake filling and buttery crust swirls well in my mouthüëçüëç
Peanut Mochi ü•úü•ú($1.20) - thick and chewy Mochi with subtle sweet yam filling. Ending with a nutty fragrance by the peanut powder coating. Well, it is a huge piece of Mochi.
.
.
Head down as early as possible to avoid dissapointment or call to book in advance. I reached down by 9.30am and only 3 types of tarts available at the moments. I consider myself lucky for the day. I am pretty sure it is a third of the price compared to those fancy artisan patisserie.

Barely a week old, @lowef.co serves mainly sandwiches, salads, soup, pastries and cakes. A very cosy cafe with an open kitchen concept and a special cold room(for the baker owner to make the bread, pastries and cakes in-house), helmed by a husband-and-wife team. Happened to catch the wife(my ex sec-school teacher) making lemon curd for the lemon tarts when I was there(Catch it on my Ig Story later!)! A place that I would definitely return again!

989,lowefco,Choco PBJ ($5.50),"Pullman sandwich bread baked in-house daily, with dark chocolate, jam, peanut butter and toasted almonds. I requested for the jam on the side and they obliged as this sandwich is made to order (some are premade).
As a chocolate and PB lover, I absolutely loved this sandwich. It wasn‚Äôt too sweet thanks to the use of dark chocolate, and the addition of sliced almonds was amazing because of the crunch and nutty flavours. I think the jam might be made in house too, and it is pretty good. It‚Äôs slightly tart and not too sweet. The texture isn‚Äôt thick and goop-like unlike many sold commercially, so I did find it a nice addition to give my mouth a break from the rich and creamy peanut butter and dark chocolate from time to time. I did appreciate that the amount of spreads on the bread was controlled, and the ratio of Choc PB to bread was good albeit a little unevenly spread. The bread is really nice and soft too, but I think the sandwich would‚Äôve been better if the bread were toasted and crispier.

1026,lowefco,Chocolate Cherry Tart ($5),"Tarts are usually only baked on weekends or public holidays, and I was lucky to see the Chocolate Cherry Tart and Lemon Tart on display. My eyes went straight to the chocolate tart, with a contrasting half cocoa dusted layer and the precise line of cacao nibs, it was certainly gorgeous. 
Each of the tarts are handmade, and the amount of pride and hard work that goes into them are evident. The owner, Don, shared that they were made with chocolate imported from Europe and morello cherries to give that winning bitter and sour combination. The base is also made from rye which is good for the gut, so this tart is also healthier! 
The tart base holds up very nicely, and keeps its shape without crumbling even after we sliced it into 8 pieces. It is the right thickness and the taste of the chocolate tart base is on point. The chocolate filling also holds its shape well, but remains soft to the touch and melts lusciously in your mouth. I loved the rich and slightly bitter chocolate, especially the half with the cocoa dusting. The cherries do impart a certain tartness that cuts through while complementing the bitterness, and it‚Äôs an incredibly addictive combination that I couldn‚Äôt get enough of. For a small cafe that doesn‚Äôt even specialise in making tarts, I was blown away by this chocolate tart. It‚Äôs not the most polished (I do like this exterior better than the crisp smooth tarts that many patisseries sell though), but it‚Äôs the most honest to goodness and most affordable I‚Äôve come across so far. I‚Äôd definitely recommend picking up a tart if you do see it when you visit Lowe‚Äôf, because I definitely will!",Melissa Chee,@melchee92,food,chocolate cherry tart tarts usually baked weekends public holidays lucky,0.0,food,food,chocolate cherry tart tart usually baked weekend public holiday lucky,chocol cherri tart tart usual bake weekend public holiday lucki

It‚Äôs not the most polished (I do like this exterior better than the crisp smooth tarts that many patisseries sell though), but it‚Äôs the most honest to goodness and most affordable I‚Äôve come across so far. I‚Äôd definitely recommend picking up a tart if you do see it when you visit Lowe‚Äôf, because I definitely will!",Melissa Chee,@melchee92,service,good,1.0,service,service,good,good

Two of their more popular items include the Grilled Chicken with Salted Egg Yolk ($9), an interesting combination between a grill meat with our local favourite sauce. The sauce has bits of salted egg in it which was a nice surprise, away from the generic salted egg dishes that were either too sweet or gets a bit gelat after a few bites. The only thing that I have a gripe with is the garlic rice which can be improved further as it is lacking in seasoning and flavour. On the other hand, the Smoked Suckling Pig with Glutinous Rice ($16) fared much better overall as the crispy skin on the pork was just amazing that day. Not really a big fan of glutinous rice, this got me eating quite a bit as it was nicely balanced and the addition of Chinese sausage, mushrooms and century eggs gives it a nice flavour.

1155,meatsmith-western-bbq,"You might recognise Chef Dave Pynt of Michelin One Star restaurant, Burnt Ends, but do you know he has recently opened a hawker stall?","Located at the newly renovated Makansutra Gluttons Bay, the stall features a limited lineup of menu items with British and Asian influences in the flavours and food preparation. Two of their more popular items include the Grilled Chicken with Salted Egg Yolk ($9), an interesting combination between a grill meat with our local favourite sauce. The sauce has bits of salted egg in it which was a nice surprise, away from the generic salted egg dishes that were either too sweet or gets a bit gelat after a few bites. The only thing that I have a gripe with is the garlic rice which can be improved further as it is lacking in seasoning and flavour. On the other hand, the Smoked Suckling Pig with Glutinous Rice ($16) fared much better overall as the crispy skin on the pork was just amazing that day. Not really a big fan of glutinous rice, this got me eating quite a bit as it was nicely balanced and the addition of Chinese sausage, mushrooms and century eggs gives it a nice flavour.

1227,mona-lounge,Mona's Tea ($22).,"""At that red teahouse, we finally exchange vows"". This intimate space transports you to the glamourous period of 1980s Hong Kong with mahjong tables and cosy leather seats, but it's hidden from public view. Access can be requested at Sum Yi Tai, where you ask to see Mona and be presented with a unique code for a locked door that leads to Mona Lounge; or via reservations at drink@monalounge.com where the passcode will be provided upon confirmation.

And this cocktail gives you a glimpse into Mona's past. The modernised Asian cocktail menu combines the expertise of Head Bartender Byron Tan and Group Chief Bartender Sam Wong. I started my cocktail journey here with this Mona‚Äôs Tea, a cognac-based cocktail made with oolong PX sherry and Fernet Branca, beautifully presented in a teacup. Served with salted egg chocolate made by Singapore‚Äôs own craft chocolatier Fossa Chocolate, the sweetness from the cognac is perfectly balanced with the bitterness of the Fernet Branca, elevated with a touch of oolong PX sherry.
üî∏
I've also tried 3 other cocktails here, as I had the lovely company of Mona Lounge owners Eu Yen and Sandra who wanted me to try a couple of their favorite drinks. I found that they are sufficiently complex yet very well balanced. This would be one of my favourite places to come for a drink after work. Moreover, the ambience here is perfect to have a drink by yourself, and it's chill enough to hold conversations with a friend.

First, the kalguksu. The first thought that came to my mind when it was served was that I definitely overpaid for it. The soup was fairly light, without much substance to it. For the first minutes the noodles were quite chewy and had a nice mouth feel to them. However, they quickly lost their structure and became a mushy mess. The shredded chicken was also poorly integrated into the dish, and even had bones leftover in them.
Next, the naengmyeon. The noodles were rather on point. Although they looked like they were beehoon noodles, they were actually quite chewy, exactly how you expect your naengmyeon noodles to be like. However, the soup left much to be desired. It was kinda plain, and not soup enough. They do however provide you with vinegar so you can adjust to your tastes. They also provide mustard.

First, the kalguksu. The first thought that came to my mind when it was served was that I definitely overpaid for it. The soup was fairly light, without much substance to it. For the first minutes the noodles were quite chewy and had a nice mouth feel to them. However, they quickly lost their structure and became a mushy mess. The shredded chicken was also poorly integrated into the dish, and even had bones leftover in them.
Next, the naengmyeon. The noodles were rather on point. Although they looked like they were beehoon noodles, they were actually quite chewy, exactly how you expect your naengmyeon noodles to be like. However, the soup left much to be desired. It was kinda plain, and not soup enough. They do however provide you with vinegar so you can adjust to your tastes. They also provide mustard.

Sandwiched between the brioche bun, the 160g beef patty was indeed juicy by enhancing the flavour the Gochujang sauce is then spread on top of the patty thus adding the sweetness of the patty while giving it an extra tangly sensation. I just wish there were bits of onions mixed into the patty giving it extra crunchiness texture.

Even though after pan-frying the bun, there was still lack of crispy texture from it. The add-on truffle made me regretted not ordering the chilli crab fries instead as I could hardly taste any hint of truffle.",Wan Yu Elton Goh,@eltonventure,food,price,0.0,price,,price,price

1401,old-hen-kitchen,Salmon and Soba,"10 Dec‚Äô17, Sun
Salmon and Soba (warm) at Old Hen Kitchen...
Moist and tender salmon with crispy skin and warm soba, tasty! Find it a little salty but otherwise, this is great!üòã
As for the portobello aglio olio, my friend had a special request to go without the bacon, the taste is good but she find it a little spicy for her...
Moving on to their drinks, their white is good too! They got their coffee beans from Nylon Coffee Roasters and the one I had is a little towards fruity taste, not bad at all!‚òïÔ∏è
As for their bottled matcha milk, I like it as it is not-that-sweet, with a hint of matcha‚Äôs bitterness, but do expect the very rich milky taste since this is a matcha MILK okay~üçµ
The open-concept kitchen allows us to have a preview of how our food is being prepared but I prefer to sit a little further away from the kitchen so as to avoid getting the smell stuck on me...üôä
Like how the cafe setting is, filled with paintings and plants (instagram props)...ü§£
The service is good, the staff served us politely with smile and making us feel welcomed! 
Not like some of the cafes which clear your plates quickly once you are done and checking you out on-and-off (that kind of pressure to hint you to leave) or might as well ask if you can give up your seats for other diners directly...
Instead of chasing us away after we are done with our meal, the staff actually replenished the bottle of plain water on our table as we chatted our time away...
Overall, for the food, coffee, ambience and service, I will be back again!
Damage: $19 (Salmon and Soba) + $19 Portobello Aglio Olio + $4.50 (White) + $7 (Bottled Matcha Milk)

Like how the cafe setting is, filled with paintings and plants (instagram props)...ü§£
The service is good, the staff served us politely with smile and making us feel welcomed! 
Not like some of the cafes which clear your plates quickly once you are done and checking you out on-and-off (that kind of pressure to hint you to leave) or might as well ask if you can give up your seats for other diners directly...
Instead of chasing us away after we are done with our meal, the staff actually replenished the bottle of plain water on our table as we chatted our time away...
Overall, for the food, coffee, ambience and service, I will be back again!
Damage: $19 (Salmon and Soba) + $19 Portobello Aglio Olio + $4.50 (White) + $7 (Bottled Matcha Milk)

Salmon and Soba (warm) at Old Hen Kitchen...
Moist and tender salmon with crispy skin and warm soba, tasty! Find it a little salty but otherwise, this is great!üòã
As for the portobello aglio olio, my friend had a special request to go without the bacon, the taste is good but she find it a little spicy for her...
Moving on to their drinks, their white is good too! They got their coffee beans from Nylon Coffee Roasters and the one I had is a little towards fruity taste, not bad at all!‚òïÔ∏è

1467,old-world-bakuteh,Old World kinda simple goodness,"Deep peppery bak kut teh which appeals to lovers of BKT because of it‚Äôs strong peppery spice. But I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs sth extremely ‚Äúwow‚Äù! The ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor comes primarily from the delectable meesua and fried porridge. It‚Äôs so, so, so, flavoursome. Meesua was extremely cheap (+$0.50) as add-on to any of the additional mains ordered (fried porridge included). Even w/o the add-on price, it‚Äôs priced at $0.80, definitely very affordable too! 
I‚Äôm not a fan of mixed organs, or any other innards. So I opted for the sliced pork fried porridge instead. Can I say, it‚Äôs extremely savoury! At $5/bowl, it‚Äôs definitely not the cheapest porridge but the size‚Äôs at least 20% larger than the usual ones at cheaper price.

I loved every course that was served but I believe the chu toro with shoyu foam was a unanimous favourite with the very interesting texture from the savoury foam that worked so well with the sufficiently fatty chutoro.
The other nigiri sushi were damn good too - Sea bream w truffle shoyu, shima yuzu, kanpachi, ika with sesame, torched alfonsino, akami, chu toro with shoyu foam, shime saba, torched salmon with truffle soya (which chef proclaimed will dissolve, not just melt in your mouth and it was üëçüèº!!) Also had a seemingly simple but very satisfyingly tasty sweet kani handroll with truffle, wrapped with crisp seaweed.
Not only was the seafood fresh with every element well-thought for a medley of flavours and textures in each course with seasoning done right without distracting one from the freshness, the rice is a very important part and it was done well here.

I was lucky to be sitting at the bar counter with the best view and also served by Chef Roy, the chef-owner featured on @sethluicious video. Having each individual pieces of sushi freshly hand-made before me was a great experience itself. For the price & quality I‚Äôm getting, everything was just amazing, to the point that I kinda regretted not going straight for their $68 set (during the course). If I had to pick my favourite piece of sushi, it will be their Torched Scallop with Sea Saltüòã. Special mentions include their Cured Akami with Yuzu Zest, Aburi Salmon & Crab Hand Roll!

Being uni lovers, we went for the 18-course sea urchin menu.
The three bowls of starters serves to whet your appetite and awaken your taste buds as you await for the main dishes to be served.
Each of the premium sushi was carefully prepared with different seasonings that provide a different overall taste to the usual sushis in restaurants. While the ingredients enough was good enough (the fatty tuna really melts in your mouth), the seasonings kick it up a notch to bring your taste buds to different level of euphoria.
The handroll contained a generous amount of crabmeat - to the extent that I was tasting crabmeat with almost every bite!
I enjoyed the small sea urchin bowl tremendously, with its generous amount of uni mixed in with the rice (the rice grains are coated with uni!) The ikura gives that bursting goodness which prevents your taste bud from getting excessively sick (jerlat) of the same taste being repeated over and over in your mouth. Very nice touch, I must say.
And of course, who doesn‚Äôt enjoy a warm bowl of soup? The last dish to the course helps to calm down those excited tastebuds while bringing warmth and comfort to the tummy.
That was definitely 1.5 hours well-spent and well-digested. Good value for money, considering how costly omakase meals usually are and the amount of unis that were consumed that night.

Butter chicken, with tandoori inside mixed with butter chicken sauce. The sauce was really thick, and when you mix your garlic naan or papadum inside it makes a great combination. Garlic naan was chewy, but rather small I must say. Next we have the plain thosai, I loved how unique the texture was, and it was actually my first time trying it, so I really find that a unique one. Their special briyani had long grain rice and lots of other side dishes to go along with it! ü§ó

1846,tambuah-mas,Indonesian Home Style Cuisine,"This was a lunch menu catered for some students we were hosting. 
The tahu telur (bottom right corner) was definitely a major highlight. Cubes of egg tofu were deep fried to a crispy golden brown and topped with a halo of deep fried egg white. It was doused with some a thick, sweet and spicy dark sauce. The combination of silky tofu and deep fried batter was heavenly. The egg white halo soaked up the sauce and turned it into dripping strings of deliciousness which I ate like noodles. And that delightfully savory sauce coated everything with its perfect balance of sweetness and tanginess. 
Another highlight was their signature fried chicken (top right corner). Served piping hot, the strong whiff of Indonesian spices shone through with every bite. The breast meat was not dry but instead tore apart easily, and the meat inside glistened with chicken juice. I was so impressed because it wasn't the least bit oily despite its delightful crispiness.
Finally, their chendol which (not pictured here) finished off our delicious meal with a bang. Served with coconut milk and gula melaka with bits of sago spooned into the bottom, it was sweet, rich and the perfect respite from Singapore's heat.
All in all, really delicious, authentic, well-executed Indonesian food with familiar, time-tested flavors. I loved the food here.

Overall, a rather satisfactory meal apart from how oily it was.

‚Ä¢you can choose the portion you want: petite, regular, large, and xtra large to suit your appetite so you won't waste money not finishing it and feel satisfied.
‚Ä¢the edamame I chose is really nice. They mixed some chili sauce(its not spicy at all) to add flavour
‚Ä¢the salmon is really well cooked and they are very generous to give 2 pc
‚Ä¢the brown rice is quite nice too, I don't know how to describe
‚Ä¢I don't exactly like the dressing because its a bit sour and I personally like plain stuff
‚Ä¢Although it looks small, its actually quite filling
‚Ä¢the foods are mostly prepared and precooked so the waiting time for the food is actually very short
‚Ä¢I couldn't finish it maybe cos I've had come cakes before but they allowed me to take away so thats good but they aren't looking very happy and friendly but oh wellls HAHA

1960,the-wine-gourmet-friends,[The Wine & Gourmet Friends] - Foie Gras Lotus Rice ($18).,"Foie Gras and rice to me is an unusual combination but the chemistry between these two ingredients was better than expected. Perhaps the idea came from replacing liver with foie gras (just guessing), the role of foie gras in the rice was like that of a stir-fried pork liver but with an additional creamy texture. It was seared to attain a slight crisp on its surface, which released a layer of sweet gaminess into the savoury rice. Being the centerpiece of a dish usually, it did not steal any limelight from the lotus leaf rice, which was just as outstanding on its own. Fragrant with oriental seasoning and condiments, Calrose rice is used instead of glutinous rice to lighten the load from your stomach. Glutinous rice would certainly be too soft and sweet for this dish to succeed. I love the chopped porcini and shiitake mushrooms, and the Chinese X.O. sausage which added another dimension of flavours and texture. The fried lotus chips were not necessary, as they turned greasy towards the end.

I am pretty much a fan of chickpeas and falafel so this burger pretty much caught my attention when I was skimming through the menu. This reminds me of middle eastern food; really liked that smooth, mushy chickpea patty that is all crisp with its fried, crusted exterior ‚Äî it comes with nibs of corn for some texture too. The entire burger was flavoursome; the combination of the Falafel Patty, the Tzatziki, Kale and Tomato Compote was everything tangy, zippy and savoury, while the buns were pretty light and fluffy. The sweet potato fries are well-seasoned with salt while sweet inside; pretty crisp though turns a little hard if left alone for a while. A steal at $12 ‚Äî the portion is actually pretty substantial; definitely leaves one full after wiping out the entire portion.",Xing Wei Chua,@the_xw,food,burgerfrom wired monkey dunlop street new,0.0,food,,burgerfrom wired monkey dunlop street new,burgerfrom wire monkey dunlop street new

3148,muk-bang-korean-restaurant,Budae Jiggae,"For $39 bucks, this Budae Jiggae was good for 2-3 pax. Broth was tasty and worth it with a generous mix of chicken and veg. It wasn't spicy at all.
The mushroom Japchae($8) we ordered was just meh. It was lacking ingredients like mushrooms (it's a mushroom dish), sesame oil and it had a strong raw carroty taste. We decided it tasted better dropped into our army stew. 
Would be great if they offered free banchan (side dishes) like other Korean places but they don't.
One thing that could use serious improvement though is the customer service. We were blantedly ignored by 3 different waiters and waitresses even though the place wasn't busy. We only wanted to call for additional water and these service people saw us waving, but they all decided turned their heads and face another direction. They were idle at that point. Yeah... ummm real friendly. So when we finally got the female waitress to stop to hear us out 15 minutes later when she scooted past, first thing she did was to slot us a receipt. Which came as a surprise too because nobody told us iced water was chargeable and on a non-refillable basis. Water came 10mins later. What a tale lol. 
We might come again for the variety- food was decent but we think the service could be better. This place would be good for family gatherings or with muslim friends.

Yeah... ummm real friendly. So when we finally got the female waitress to stop to hear us out 15 minutes later when she scooted past, first thing she did was to slot us a receipt. Which came as a surprise too because nobody told us iced water was chargeable and on a non-refillable basis. Water came 10mins later. What a tale lol. 
We might come again for the variety- food was decent but we think the service could be better. This place would be good for family gatherings or with muslim friends.

The mushroom Japchae($8) we ordered was just meh. It was lacking ingredients like mushrooms (it's a mushroom dish), sesame oil and it had a strong raw carroty taste. We decided it tasted better dropped into our army stew. 
Would be great if they offered free banchan (side dishes) like other Korean places but they don't.

3254,takagi-ramen-blk-498-jurong-west-street-41,I rather eat Instant Ramen,"The first time I chanced upon Takagi Ramen on Grabfood, I was excited as it was during CB period and I was craving for Ramen. It was with such excitement coursing through my veins that I proceeded to order a Karakamen set (with Fried Gyoza). 
However, upon receiving the Ramen, my excitement quickly dissipated to be swiftly replaced with disappointment. 
The noodles were stiff and had a weird aftertaste and the soup had so much of the chilli Oil added that I could only taste the oil and none of the soup which made eating the ramen an unpleasant experience. The ramen egg that came along with it was so bland that I think the Hanjuku Eggs of 7-11 would taste like heaven. All in all, my family members and I came to a conclusion that the best item of this Ramen Set was the fried gyoza. 
Fast forward to yesterday, when my friends and I were looking to have dinner after our exercise session, we happen to come across this outlet at Jurong West and immediately, alarm bells start ringing in my head. Although I was very hesitant to have this, seeing how my friends did not try it before and we were very very hungry, I decided to give this another chance. 
I ordered the Black Tonkotsu Set (with fried gyoza and nope no egg for fearing of what‚Äôs to come). When the noodles arrived, the aromatic smell of the Black Garlic Oil rumbled my stomach juices and I was thinking ‚Äúwow will eating here make a difference, is it redemption time ?‚Äù. However that thought was quickly put to bed upon the first sip of the soup. For all the aromatics of the black garlic oil, the soup was very very lacklustre and it was only until I added almost all of the chilli powder did it have some form of character to it. All in all, my friends and I agreed unanimously that the star of the ramen set was the fried gyoza & the chilli powder.
All in all, I think the $$ we paid for the ramen (avg of $16) is not worth it. Perhaps, to compare this Ramen to other more ‚Äúfamous‚Äù Ramen brands in Singapore is very unfair as it would be akin to comparing a Toyota to a Nissan GT-R. A more suitable comparison to this would be Ajisen Ramen but I vividly recall that the broth of Ajisen Ramen was more flavourful....

About $14.
At first plan to eat at the Claypot Rice yesterday but it would not ready till 12noon, so ended up here. Could not clearly see what was available so anyhow ordered some.
The curry was thick and gooey without too spicy. Best dish mush be the braised pork belly. The sambal sotong also not bad.

3452,eleven-strands,Braised Beef Cheeks ($25),"The mushrooms were really the star, cooked to perfection and that umami flavour really lifted and carried this dish. 
While the beef was tender with perfect texture, I felt like it was sorely under seasoned. I tried moping up with sauce with it but it didn't do much for me. The mashed potatoes were good but that's it, nothing spectacular. I was expecting it to be creamier as previous reviews have raved about. I definitely have had better at other cafes at similar prices. 
If you are into subtle flavours, this would be great for you. Otherwise, asking for some salt and pepper would probably do you some good. 
Ambience is great, the interior is lovely. I came at 3pm on a weekday and it was empty and it's a great place to chill and hangout with friends.
Honestly, I've heard many good things about Eleven Strands and naturally my expectations were high. I was disappointed with my experience here not because the food was bad, but because it just didn't seem that great. Its quite pricey if not for burpple beyond.

3634,eleven-strands,Pork Chop,"Eleven strands is a cafe that has been quite a trend recently, with some around me giving rave reviews about the place.
Starting with looks: the plating was decent, could do with the elements being packed tighter on the plate. The individual elements in the dish were done well. Nice to see the pork with char grill marks, and a large enough portion (even though it was slightly dry, slightly overdone), the sauce tasted good, apples were nicely caramelised.
However, the dish overall was not cohesive, and not balanced. There were too many sweet notes, with the apples, pickled onions. The pork and mashed potatoes were not salty enough to balance it. The cream based sauce was also not appropriate as it has an element of sweetness in its balance; a brown sauce would have added a more savoriness to balance the overall dish.

At first glance, it's an impressive pile of rice. Its piled higher than in their promo picture and packed pretty compactly. Even after the sauce was drizzled over the rice, it didn't collapse. Points for sturdy construction. 
To call it a fried rice, nah. More like mixed rice. Just cooked Japanese rice mixed with those kind of frozen mixed vegetable bits. Rice lacked any seasoning at all. The accompanying condiments were quite little. If you were to mix everything together, it's alot more rice. 
Speaking of the rice, I reckon there's about 2-3 bowls of rice in that tower. Unless you can really eat so much rice, if not you should not get this. 
The star of the dish is the salted egg yolk sauce. Creamy, rich. Somehow, you won't get sick of this sauce. It sort of makes up for the weak and rather tasteless rice. We had a refill of the sauce. It's an additional of $2. 
The sides are always well done. The takoyaki is crispy on the outside, soft and goey on the inside. I wish there was more than 6. The Gyoza, nothing special.
