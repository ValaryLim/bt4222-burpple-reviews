It can get too savoury at some point, hence, you must eat it with rice and balance it off with some of the herbal broth.

⭐️ 3.5/5 ⭐️
🍴Relatively affordable, nicely grilled meat in town.","The teriyaki chicken was tender and there was a good portion for the price. Paying $1 more for the soba option instead of rice also came with Japanese-style sides of tofu with sesame and soya sauce Japanese cucumber which was a delicious and good pairing to the chicken (instead of orange and coleslaw). Would have liked for the soba to have slightly more sauce / sesame & seaweed as it was a bit tasteless and plain by itself

Went late arnd 9pm and didn’t have to queue (yay!!). Between my parents and I, we ordered 2 portions to share (cos my mum is a small eater haha). We got the Kaisen x Hitsumabushi by Teppei and Man Man ($32.50) and the Large Hitsumabushi ($39.40 I think?). We enjoyed the meal, and both the sashimi cubes and unagi didn’t disappoint. I think the grilling of the unagi wasn’t completely consistent though, as I tried the unagi from both bowls and found that those in one bowl were significantly more charred than the other and a little tougher in texture.

Went late arnd 9pm and didn’t have to queue (yay!!). Between my parents and I, we ordered 2 portions to share (cos my mum is a small eater haha). We got the Kaisen x Hitsumabushi by Teppei and Man Man ($32.50) and the Large Hitsumabushi ($39.40 I think?). We enjoyed the meal, and both the sashimi cubes and unagi didn’t disappoint. I think the grilling of the unagi wasn’t completely consistent though, as I tried the unagi from both bowls and found that those in one bowl were significantly more charred than the other and a little tougher in texture. It wasn’t that big a problem to me though, as it was still nice enough to be enjoyable. Having the collaborative bowl actually solves the dilemma I have always had. Now I can have the best of both worlds:) #sgfood #sgfoodlover #sgfoodtrend #sgfoodporn #sgfoodstagram #foodphotography #sgfooddiary #sgfoodies #sgfoodblogger #instafoodsg #foodsg #foodiesg #sgeats #sgrestaurant #japaneserestaurant #japanesefood #sgjapanesefood #donburi #japanesedon #unagi #unagidon #drinks #beer #burpple #teppei #kaisendon #singaporeinsiders #newopening",Pig Eats Ball Travels 🐷,@pigeatsballtravels,portion,"tougher, texture","['tougher', 'texture']",['tougher'],-1,food,food

Tried the medium unagi donburi, which comes with unagi don, soup, appetizer (spinach), pickles. Very filling! 
The unagi don was really delicious - I love that the unagi was slightly charred and crispy and very flavourful! The fish was chewy with just the right amount of fat. 😋 The Japanese rice was, as usual, exceptional hehe. I always try to avoid eating too much carbs but I can never resist Japanese rice. 
The soup was actually really good too! Had not much expectations because it looks quite simple, but there were bits of yuzu peels in the soup which made the soup super refreshing! And I’m a huge fan of yuzu 🤩
The appetizer and pickles were nothing to shout about, but was a nice touch as it balances out the sweetness of the unagi.

Hainan Curry Rice for our mid-week lunch! Each plate is reasonable priced at $4/$5+ with lots of ingredients. There’s a wide variety of ingredients to choose from and some of our MUST ORDER dishes are Fried Pork Chop, Fried Prawn, Egg Floss, Cabbage and Pan-fried Long Beans! Egg floss was something unique and unusual in a Hainanese curry rice stall, it’s very light, fluffy and airy. Fried Pork chop were fried in small batches to ensure it’s crispiness and freshness when served. Their golden curry sauce is da bomb!! It’s absolutely delicious, with a lil sweet and savory, lil sticky and you can actually taste the fragrant curry spices in it! We love it when the aromatic curry covers the entire plate of white rice before they place the ingredients on top of it! If you order more curry, you may request for extra curry to go with it! Definitely the place to go to, to fix our Hainanese curry rice cravings! Satisfied and comforting at the same time👍🏼 .

Egg floss was something unique and unusual in a Hainanese curry rice stall, it’s very light, fluffy and airy. Fried Pork chop were fried in small batches to ensure it’s crispiness and freshness when served. Their golden curry sauce is da bomb!! It’s absolutely delicious, with a lil sweet and savory, lil sticky and you can actually taste the fragrant curry spices in it! We love it when the aromatic curry covers the entire plate of white rice before they place the ingredients on top of it! If you order more curry, you may request for extra curry to go with it! Definitely the place to go to, to fix our Hainanese curry rice cravings! Satisfied and comforting at the same time👍🏼 .

Just received a saddening news... Our favourite Hainanese curry rice - Old Hainan will be ceasing operations from next Thursday, 31st October! 😢😭😢😭 .
.
On a brighter note, they will be relocating to a new location in December, stay tune.. From now till next Thurs, 31 October, they are open 9am-3pm everyday except Friday. So if you enjoys a mouth-watering plate of hainan curry rice like us, you should make a few more trips down to indulge before they close! We are so hooked to their crispy pork chop that’s fresh fried out from the frying pot, soft cabbage, and those delicious and amazing curry gravy that the white rice was fully soak in! .

Popiah is a very simple dish. Mainly assemble with the parts b/m.
1. The skin - the owner hand made every skin. He will grab a ball of very thick batter and spread a thin layer on to the hot plate. Fried it for less than 2mins. If the skin got too thick, the popiah will taste very heavy. If too thin, it can't contain the juicy turnip.
2. Stir fried Turnip - the uncle told me that frying turnip required patient. It must be fried till it's color turn light brownish as it's starch started to caramelize. Then it's sweetness could be portray out fully.
3. Crispy Golden Bits.
The crispy bits provided an savory sweet flavor which was so comforting to the mouth.
4. Unforgettable chili.

2. Stir fried Turnip - the uncle told me that frying turnip required patient. It must be fried till it's color turn light brownish as it's starch started to caramelize. Then it's sweetness could be portray out fully.
3. Crispy Golden Bits.
The crispy bits provided an savory sweet flavor which was so comforting to the mouth.
4. Unforgettable chili.
While you getting bore from the sweet turnip and savory bits, suddenly a tickling sensation was felt and kick started the taste bud again.

3993,oven-marvel-at-sushine-plaza,Here’s a little secret I’m sharing with you on the foodie haven happening inside the nondescript Sunshine Plaza.,"Besides the many printing shops and dim sum place that this place is known for, there’s actually several hidden gems that’s changing the landscape of this place. Recommended by @gladysng_27, there’s two pit stops that you have to make when here, one a little Japanese eatery and another a bakery wizardry. Located at the centre of the first level, they are located a few units away from each other and you will most probably miss it if you didn’t look closely as there’s no fanciful decoration both inside and out. However, if there’s one thing that you can rely on, it’s definitely your sense of smell. My first stop is to Ichi Tei and there was no denying me from getting the Saba Set ($10), which was absolutely a steal and value-for-money set as you get a huge piece of grilled saba that has been spiced with shio, miso soup, Japanese rice and a side salad. The star of the show is undeniably the saba as it was grilled perfectly and with a squeeze of lemon, it elevated the dish and gives life to it, with the right balance of tangy and savoury while the meat cooked to the right texture. Next up, it’s to Oven Marvel, which is a homemade bakery that’s so discreet that you wouldn’t know how popular they are. Specialising in only chicken pies, muffins and curry puffs, most stuff are baked to order and usually gets sold out very quickly. Based on the few minutes that I was there, there were several people who went in, got their pre-ordered items that are packed in boxes and left, which is a testament to their popularity. Even their countertop don’t have much bakes left on sale, however we were fortunately to sample their curry puff ($2.80), which was filled with generous portions of potato cubes and chicken meat, encased in a wonderful buttery pastry.

However, if there’s one thing that you can rely on, it’s definitely your sense of smell. My first stop is to Ichi Tei and there was no denying me from getting the Saba Set ($10), which was absolutely a steal and value-for-money set as you get a huge piece of grilled saba that has been spiced with shio, miso soup, Japanese rice and a side salad. The star of the show is undeniably the saba as it was grilled perfectly and with a squeeze of lemon, it elevated the dish and gives life to it, with the right balance of tangy and savoury while the meat cooked to the right texture. Next up, it’s to Oven Marvel, which is a homemade bakery that’s so discreet that you wouldn’t know how popular they are. Specialising in only chicken pies, muffins and curry puffs, most stuff are baked to order and usually gets sold out very quickly. Based on the few minutes that I was there, there were several people who went in, got their pre-ordered items that are packed in boxes and left, which is a testament to their popularity. Even their countertop don’t have much bakes left on sale, however we were fortunately to sample their curry puff ($2.80), which was filled with generous portions of potato cubes and chicken meat, encased in a wonderful buttery pastry.

4011,oven-marvel-at-sushine-plaza,Best $4 I've ever spent on a pie.,"Tucked away in Sunshine Plaza, Oven Marvel is a cozy bakery started by ex-Hilton Hotel pastry chef, Chef Johnny Ngiam. The puff pastry is buttery and flaky, and has a beautiful aroma. The pastry balance is just right, buttery but not too oily, yet not dry. You'll find chunks of chicken and unshrivelled peas in a peppery, creamy mashed potato filling, complementing the pastry in the most wonderful way.

I didn't know about his place until he mentioned (or kpkb) it.

We visited the branch at JEM, Jurong East. The place was nice and cozy and quite packed during dinner time. We ordered a Teriyaki Chicken with Egg, a Chicken Curry Cheesy Risotto and a bowl of Mashed Potato.
The Mashed Potato was smooth and the gravy on top was neither too salty nor oily. However, we felt that it was not as good as the one at the Jurong Point Branch.
The Teriyaki Chicken with Egg is the safe option as we had tried it several times. Mixing it with an adequate amount of Honey Brown Sauce and Garlic Soy Sauce and we got a hot plate of pure goodness!
The Chicken Curry Cheesy Risotto was fantastic as well and the highlight was probably watching the cheese melt on the rice and seeing how high it could stretch when we pulled it.
What is your favourite dish at Pepper Lunch?
Note: Do take your photos of the dish quickly as the rice and meat may get charred if you do not stir it fast!

The Mashed Potato was smooth and the gravy on top was neither too salty nor oily. However, we felt that it was not as good as the one at the Jurong Point Branch.
The Teriyaki Chicken with Egg is the safe option as we had tried it several times. Mixing it with an adequate amount of Honey Brown Sauce and Garlic Soy Sauce and we got a hot plate of pure goodness!
The Chicken Curry Cheesy Risotto was fantastic as well and the highlight was probably watching the cheese melt on the rice and seeing how high it could stretch when we pulled it.
What is your favourite dish at Pepper Lunch?
Note: Do take your photos of the dish quickly as the rice and meat may get charred if you do not stir it fast!

Teriyaki Chicken with Egg: $11.90

Definitely had to try the Thai boat noodles since it was a specialty.

So smooth on your tongue, it's gentle on satay spice and the fragrance of nuts with virtually no oil. More savoury than sweet, light on the heat, it carries notes of curry, giving you deep umami without being cloying. Take it in with the soft chew of cured cuttlefish, a slice of lean pork or their succulent prawns and cockles, fresh and cooked pink.

So smooth on your tongue, it's gentle on satay spice and the fragrance of nuts with virtually no oil. More savoury than sweet, light on the heat, it carries notes of curry, giving you deep umami without being cloying. Take it in with the soft chew of cured cuttlefish, a slice of lean pork or their succulent prawns and cockles, fresh and cooked pink. Pair your mouthful with crunchy beansprouts and Kang Kong or tau pok that top it off.

I think it’s really damn expensive for craft beer in a hawker center:/ I do appreciate the interesting range of beers ( the cup states young master brewery which is from Hong Kong✨) but in consideration of the growing presence of craft beer culture in Singapore, the price does not give it an edge above the rest.","As I was sitting far away from the stall, i got to choose the takeaway option or return the cup after. It really diminishes the experience and value of the craft beer. I personally won’t go back specially for it, but if there is an opportunity, I would really mind grabbing a pint near the stall.

The gula melaka sponge cake was layered with coconut-gula melaka fudge. There's also generous amount of azuki red beans and the green chendol interspersed throughout. It does taste like our chendol dessert, in a fluffy creamy form.

Since Starbucks changed their deep dish beef pie to have potatoes > cheese, I don't have a pie to go to anymore and see myself visiting them less. Now with this pie in the options, I might be more regular.... Pie to Price ratio though, rather steep to be having too often.

4932,starbucks-hillion-mall,#majorthrowback: Kouign Amann with a cup of warm hot chocolate from @starbuckssg on a rainy weekend morning.,"Personally felt that the kouign amann was dry and it did not have the buttery fragrance that I expected. I guess that’s coz I had a better one previously so this was a disappointment for me. The hot chocolate is warm and comforting on a colder morning because of the initial taste of the rich cocoa but after a while the sweetness of it makes it a bit too heavy. I honestly would prefer it to be more bitter instead as I would like the cocoa taste to linger longer and not get overwhelmed by the sugar. Probably opting for the tall sized option in future.

Using rump cap, the Beef Steak is by far the tastier beef I had for a protein bowl - tender with flavourful fats, and it remained easy on the jaws even after it had sat there for a while. For the base, I highly recommend Bulghur Wheat. It has the lovely, chewy bite of barley and the aromatic fragrance of brown rice. The supplements shine in their own right too. Using minimal processing to allow the natural flavours of the ingredients to shine doesn't mean merely slicing and dicing them and toss them into the salad. Still, it can also be using the best way to bring out their best, such as the house-pickled beetroot and roasted pineapple. For condiments, I reckon the fresh and fragrant Petite Herb Mix, comprising chervil, tarragon and dill will best suit the Salmon or Wild-caught Barramundi, or even the Beef Steak. To add some crunch and nuttiness into your salad, the spiced Dukkah will be ideal, especially if you have a vegetarian-protein pan-fried miso-glazed tofu.

Using rump cap, the Beef Steak is by far the tastier beef I had for a protein bowl - tender with flavourful fats, and it remained easy on the jaws even after it had sat there for a while. For the base, I highly recommend Bulghur Wheat. It has the lovely, chewy bite of barley and the aromatic fragrance of brown rice. The supplements shine in their own right too. Using minimal processing to allow the natural flavours of the ingredients to shine doesn't mean merely slicing and dicing them and toss them into the salad. Still, it can also be using the best way to bring out their best, such as the house-pickled beetroot and roasted pineapple. For condiments, I reckon the fresh and fragrant Petite Herb Mix, comprising chervil, tarragon and dill will best suit the Salmon or Wild-caught Barramundi, or even the Beef Steak. To add some crunch and nuttiness into your salad, the spiced Dukkah will be ideal, especially if you have a vegetarian-protein pan-fried miso-glazed tofu.

We went for the 5-course set lunch ($38++ min. 2 pax) as recommended by Mr. Kim, co-partner of the restaurant. This dish is the 4th course. Seafood beehoon in superior stock. Soft beehoon immersed in a very rich and creamy broth. Smooth consistency, abit salty but yet had a umami finish as I slurped spoonful after spoonful. Seafood was indeed fresh. I later found out that the base of the broth was from the humble carrot. Who knew, right? This was really good. And just look at the golden yellow color. Yummy to the last drop.

5329,the-lobby-lounge-at-shangri-la-hotel-singapore,Local 3-tier Afternoon Tea ($38++),"The heritage-inspired tea set sees your usual pastries infused with local flavours - savoury bites at the bottom tier, nonya kueh at the middle tier, fusion sweets at the top tier, along with pork satay and green bean soup. Items like chilli crab pie, otah mantou, kaya coconut tart, durian dome and pandan scone sound enticing, but they honestly weren't very impressive (either the filling lacked flavour or the texture was off).

Guys, DON'T GO TO ""THE ROTI PRATA HOUSE"".
The service was SO bad. The waiter spilled curry all over me and he was SO unapologetic about it. My dress, bag and phone were all stained with curry and as I type this, I smell like curry LOL.

It was a cowardly thing to say and he didn't even apologise for spilling curry ALL OVER ME. When my dad pointed this out, all he said was ""sorry OKAY, everyone makes mistakes."" Insincere, cowardly, unapologetic and a disgrace to the human race. I understand that he doesn't want to lose his job but giving a sincere apology was the least he could do. He was lucky that we let him off with just some chiding, without asking him to pay a compensation fee. It was enough drama for the day and not worth the extra rise in blood pressure. His supervisor was insincere and obnoxious as well, and was super impatient when taking our orders, telling us to ""HURRY UP"". It wasn't as if there were many customers in the shop because we visited past lunch time. Basically, the service overall was like SHIT and it's really not worth the visit unless you want your mood ruined.

Fettercairn 875 8YO
A great flight, with my favourite being the Fettercairn 875.
The nose is very grainy. Silver polish. Malt. Peach and oranges with loads of floral elements.
Oily on the palate. Very malty. Dried fruits and a hint of honey.
The finish is medium long and a little spicy with a hint of oak.

Pizza was decent but nothing to shout about, understand that they are going for a thin crust approach but we felt that the cheese and pizza sauce was a bit too little.
Confit of Duck was better than we expected. First few mouthful were a delight but as it was cream based and very rich so it became difficult to down it after the first few spoons.

What I had:
WADO's Savoury - A unique taste of sweet, salty and sour. Sweet from ice cream & biscuit, sour from the Berries, salty from the bacon. The liu sha is just a hint, can't really taste much from it. Accompanied by a black crunchy toast.😄
Thanks for the delicious meal Chef Peter.

5776,wado-dining,I’m Gonna Be Shellfish With These Cakes,"The crab cake is comfortably the more popular appetiser option on @wadodining menu, as expected. Sure, the crabby duo look kinda small & paltry in size, but do bear in mind that you’ve most likely downed a bowl of soup before this, plus you’ve got a full sized main course coming right up. And that’s not to mention dessert. All things considered, the portion size of the crab cakes are adroitly allocated.⠀
⠀
As momma always said, it’s what’s inside that counts, right? Well, yes. A creamy concoction of crabmeat cooked in a rich béchamel stuffs the crispy, deep fried casing to the gills. Yep, it’s pretty much a croquette. The crabcakes should’ve been fried for about 30 seconds longer, or in hotter oil. It was a little unappealingly pale on the plate, and one expects a little deeper shade of golden brown on a deep fried croquette.⠀
⠀
Like many of the other savoury items on the menu, I found the crab mixture within to be bland, and it was mostly creamy without much flavour. However, unlike the rest of the savouries, I didn’t mind it as much. Why, you ask? Well, the smidge of chili crab mayonnaise applied to the plate was a stroke of sheer inspiration. It’s a great example of how to adeptly infuse well loved local flavours into a western classic without any element feeling out of place.⠀
⠀
The chili crab mayo was almost a dead ringer for the chili crab sauces you’d get at an excellent Chinese seafood restaurant, with its brilliantly balanced sweet & savoury essences, and a slight but noticable sour tone at the back. Boosted by the creaminess of the mayonnaise base, this is a uniquely umami sauce. Shame there wasn’t quite enough of it, but what you do get is rather redolent.⠀

As momma always said, it’s what’s inside that counts, right? Well, yes. A creamy concoction of crabmeat cooked in a rich béchamel stuffs the crispy, deep fried casing to the gills. Yep, it’s pretty much a croquette. The crabcakes should’ve been fried for about 30 seconds longer, or in hotter oil. It was a little unappealingly pale on the plate, and one expects a little deeper shade of golden brown on a deep fried croquette.⠀

Like many of the other savoury items on the menu, I found the crab mixture within to be bland, and it was mostly creamy without much flavour. However, unlike the rest of the savouries, I didn’t mind it as much. Why, you ask? Well, the smidge of chili crab mayonnaise applied to the plate was a stroke of sheer inspiration. It’s a great example of how to adeptly infuse well loved local flavours into a western classic without any element feeling out of place.⠀

The chili crab mayo was almost a dead ringer for the chili crab sauces you’d get at an excellent Chinese seafood restaurant, with its brilliantly balanced sweet & savoury essences, and a slight but noticable sour tone at the back. Boosted by the creaminess of the mayonnaise base, this is a uniquely umami sauce. Shame there wasn’t quite enough of it, but what you do get is rather redolent.⠀

The duo from Italy 🇮🇹 are here to share some of their modest authentic recipes from their hometown.

This is one of the pasta I had the chance to savour that evening, Signature Homemade Cavatelli with Sautéed Seafood in Tomato Sauce ($38++), which had a great bite, with al dente cooked elongated shape pasta with a hollow cavity that complemented the tomato base sauce with local seafood. If you are up to taste Italy without having to fly over, trust me this is as close as it gets. So delicious, you just might bump into me if you dine there this weekend!

Valid till the 2nd of Dec (Sunday) for both lunch and dinner, enjoy the comforts of these amazing handmade dishes in the posh comforts of the restaurant.
•
One of my personal favourites would be the Orrechiette Pasta con Wagyu Ragu e Scaglie Di Parmigiana ($38++). The homemade orrechiette, or usually known as the ear pasta, has a nice bite and scoops up bits of the Wagyu stock that comes with the dish. This way, not only do you get to enjoy the braised stockyard Australian wagyu on its own, but the essence of it as well.
•
If you’re looking for something light, you can try the Trottole con Melanzane Grigliate Ricotta E Basilico ($32++). Trottole Pasta comes as little twisted ribbons, cooked with grilled eggplant which melts in your mouth, and topped with ricotta cream and basil.
•
Alternatively, the Cavatelli Con frutti Di Mare ($35++), is a loaded seafood dish packed with a punch. If you’re a seafood lover, you’d definitely enjoy this.
•
Before you dive into all that, a perfect Italian starter would be their Capocollo DOP di Martina Franca servito con Burrata Tomato Datterino e Lattuga Romana ($32++). Fresh burrata cheese that bursts upon impact is paired with juicy sliced up cherry tomatoes, cold cuts and romaine lettuce; something simply yet oh-so-delicious.
•
All these are only valid for a short period as Mamma Ria will be heading back soon! They do take reservations, so do call up the restaurant or email them!

Fresh burrata cheese that bursts upon impact is paired with juicy sliced up cherry tomatoes, cold cuts and romaine lettuce; something simply yet oh-so-delicious.
•
All these are only valid for a short period as Mamma Ria will be heading back soon! They do take reservations, so do call up the restaurant or email them!

5835,waterfall-cafe-shangrila,"Dig into authentic southern Italian homestyle favourites handcrafted by Mamma Ria, a chef and also the mother of the restaurant manager of Waterfall Ristorante Italiano of @shangrilasg!","•
Valid till the 2nd of Dec (Sunday) for both lunch and dinner, enjoy the comforts of these amazing handmade dishes in the posh comforts of the restaurant.
•
One of my personal favourites would be the Orrechiette Pasta con Wagyu Ragu e Scaglie Di Parmigiana ($38++). The homemade orrechiette, or usually known as the ear pasta, has a nice bite and scoops up bits of the Wagyu stock that comes with the dish. This way, not only do you get to enjoy the braised stockyard Australian wagyu on its own, but the essence of it as well.
•
If you’re looking for something light, you can try the Trottole con Melanzane Grigliate Ricotta E Basilico ($32++). Trottole Pasta comes as little twisted ribbons, cooked with grilled eggplant which melts in your mouth, and topped with ricotta cream and basil.
•
Alternatively, the Cavatelli Con frutti Di Mare ($35++), is a loaded seafood dish packed with a punch. If you’re a seafood lover, you’d definitely enjoy this.

.
The matcha unlike your imagination, was rather savoury, adopting much of the taste from the dashi stock; while the vegetal & astringent taste from the green tea itself was pretty subtle and didn’t taste strange at all (might be a disappointment to matcha extremist, but hey I actually like it this way!) Overall a pretty decent combination with the shabu shabu & vegetables! The only downside could be the location itself, it’s hard for me to travel all the way back to the west again 😅 Definitely worth a try though, considering the weekday off-peak prices start from $12.90++, you West-siders are a lucky bunch.

Following fellow Tastemaker Xing Wei's recommendation, I ordered Xiao Chen's competently crafted chee cheong fun but had the char siew variant instead. My body wasn't ready for just how much fun these ravishing rice rolls of deliciousness brought to my palate even though it has already been critically acclaimed.
Slightly sticky, silky smooth and thin skin that just slithers off chopsticks, Xiao Chen's chee cheong fun is one of the most finely executed rice rolls I've had. Encased within those stellar silken sheets is the lush char siew, which tended to the leaner side. The whole sublime shebang was immersed in a hot bath of titillating soy sauce, which added a strikingly savory element to the whole dish.

While some customers may think the portion is not fantastic, but there were ingredients of fresh prawns from Thailand, cuttlefish slices, strips of tender pork belly and crispy pork lard prepared fresh.
The prawn noodles were gooey and wet, absorbed some of the rich prawn stock, though not to the point when the umami-fairies would descend on the taste-buds. But good stuff.
Perhaps it was because I went relatively early to avoid peak hours, the wok-hei could have been a lot stronger.

5895,xiao-di-fried-prawn-nodle,"Hokkien Mee ($4) 😊
They have a bigger version for $5 which is more worth it in terms of portion.","There's also a $2 top up for ingredients option. This $4 small version wld not have been enough if you were hungry. Luckily i ate something else beforehand. Definitely choose the bigger option!😊 Saw another table of 3 sharing 4 plates of the $5 hokkien mee 🤔

Kaya toast shops are aplenty, and like most dishes, locals each have their favourite. A well-known chain in town, Ya Kun has various locations, one of which is in the heart of the Orchard shopping district at 313@Somerset. Come by for breakfast or tea before or in between trawling the shops. The classic Kaya Butter Toast Set ($4.80) comes with four thin pieces of toast, soft-boiled eggs (best enlivened with pepper and drizzles of black soy sauce) and a hot coffee or tea (known as kopi or teh). The star is no doubt the thinly sliced bread, toasted on a charcoal grill till crisp, then slathered with luscious kaya and sandwiched with a thin slab of chilled butter. Pro tip: Here's a trick to ordering your kopi or teh like a local.

6076,yong-xiang-xing-tou-fu,Heritage Yong Tau Foo Stall Has Super Long Queues!,"Watch the video review of the stall here: https://youtu.be/bA7_WtnbUyg
This yong tau foo (ytf) stall has been in existence since the food centre began operations in the 1970s and at the exact same spot. 
You’ll know which stall it is by the long snaking queue of people that queue up for it before its opening at 1pm. You don’t get to pick and choose the ytf items, but they are all excellently well-made as the fish paste is wonderfully smooth and springy. Tofu items have a certain smoothness, and the soup has a nice blend of pork and soybean stock flavours. 
They also serve their ytf as a set with no changes and with soup and with no rice or noodles ($4.50). A tip: if you want a second bowl, you don't have to re-queue. Just ask one of the staff (usually a lady) who will take your order and money.

This yong tau foo (ytf) stall has been in existence since the food centre began operations in the 1970s and at the exact same spot. 
You’ll know which stall it is by the long snaking queue of people that queue up for it before its opening at 1pm. You don’t get to pick and choose the ytf items, but they are all excellently well-made as the fish paste is wonderfully smooth and springy. Tofu items have a certain smoothness, and the soup has a nice blend of pork and soybean stock flavours. 
They also serve their ytf as a set with no changes and with soup and with no rice or noodles ($4.50). A tip: if you want a second bowl, you don't have to re-queue. Just ask one of the staff (usually a lady) who will take your order and money.

🔸
Pictured are what I had during a dinner there:
* Dips Platter ($28) – an appetizer consisting of five home-made dips: tzatziki, hummus, tirokafteri (spicy sheep feta cheese spread with chillis), melitzanosalata (roasted eggplant and banana peppers simmered in olive oil), and taramasalata (cured cod roe sauce with olive oil and lemon juice), served with pita bread.
* Chef Salad ($20) – Not your usual salad, this came with a combination of avocado, cucumber, celery, quinoa, red onion, pistachio, and tomato in balsamico orange dressing. Overall, a lot of sharpness and crunch.
* Lamb Kleftiko ($36) – Tender and non-gamey. This uses New Zealand lamb marinated in Mediterranean herbs, vegetables, garlic and lemon juice, before being slow-roasted till tender.
* Htapothi Sti Skhara ($30) – Tender octopus with strong grilled smokiness. The octopus is first tenderised by beating it with a smooth rock, then rubbed with the rock in a circular motion. The smokiness was achieved by slow grilling the octopus over low-burning charcoal.
* Greek Baklava ($12) – A sweet flaky pastry made of layers of filo, filled with chopped nuts, and held together with honey.
🔸
This restaurant is located in Clarke Quay, along the waterfront of Singapore River. Very idyllic location.

* Dips Platter ($28) – an appetizer consisting of five home-made dips: tzatziki, hummus, tirokafteri (spicy sheep feta cheese spread with chillis), melitzanosalata (roasted eggplant and banana peppers simmered in olive oil), and taramasalata (cured cod roe sauce with olive oil and lemon juice), served with pita bread.
* Chef Salad ($20) – Not your usual salad, this came with a combination of avocado, cucumber, celery, quinoa, red onion, pistachio, and tomato in balsamico orange dressing. Overall, a lot of sharpness and crunch.
* Lamb Kleftiko ($36) – Tender and non-gamey. This uses New Zealand lamb marinated in Mediterranean herbs, vegetables, garlic and lemon juice, before being slow-roasted till tender.
* Htapothi Sti Skhara ($30) – Tender octopus with strong grilled smokiness. The octopus is first tenderised by beating it with a smooth rock, then rubbed with the rock in a circular motion. The smokiness was achieved by slow grilling the octopus over low-burning charcoal.
* Greek Baklava ($12) – A sweet flaky pastry made of layers of filo, filled with chopped nuts, and held together with honey.
🔸
This restaurant is located in Clarke Quay, along the waterfront of Singapore River. Very idyllic location.
