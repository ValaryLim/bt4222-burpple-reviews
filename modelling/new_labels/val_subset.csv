Don‚Äôt be fooled by the clear soup, it‚Äôs actually chock full of spices that blow your mind and empty your nasal passages in one fell swoop. The explosion of flavour really shocked me in the first mouthful as I wasn‚Äôt expecting such a punch. There are other ingredient options like seafood or prawn, but I wanted something meatless since I‚Äôd already ordered a chicken dish. A few varieties of mushrooms were given and they weren‚Äôt stingy with the amount of mushrooms either.

268,casuarina-curry,For Banana Cheese Prata,"What's a supper guide without at least one spot for amazing roti prata? We had high hopes for the biryani, but as it turns out, pratas are still what Casuarina Curry does best. Like its original Casuarina Road location, the Macpherson outlet also stays open till midnight. You won't go wrong with the Plain Prata ($1), which is crisp on the outside and wonderfully fluffy within. If you're up for it, try not to miss the generously stuffed Banana Cheese Prata ($3.50) that comes drizzled with a sweet-salty caramel sauce ‚Äî it might sound strange but it is so good! If you're hankering after something more substantial, we found the Bee Hoon Goreng ($3.50) tastier than the rice. Wash it all down with a good ol' Teh Tarik ($0.90).

-The murtabuk was pleasantly surprising. It was really good. And it has a lot of meat üëçüèª Go for that!
-The butter chicken was slightly below average with regards to the taste, but there was a lot of chicken inside despite the tiny bowl.

First few times I was there after cycling before it opened at 11am.. the second time I reached at 8.45pm after evening cycling and they were already packing up to go home (though operation hours are till 9pm). This time round went during lunch and managed to try! (Though we tried to call the hp number a few times to pre order for self collection but the line was never picked up). This is the herbal seafood soup and it reminds me of OAR seafood soup! Both have two prawns, this use batang fish while the other uses dory fish. Both have pork balls but this stall's is much smaller than the other one. Overall I like both! go for this if you like the herbal taste in your soup! Oar seafood soup's broth is more of the milky fish soup kind. #seafoodsoup #herbalseafoodsoup #herbalsoup #junyuanhouseoffish #oldairportroadhawker #oldairporthawker #burpple

Both have pork balls but this stall's is much smaller than the other one. Overall I like both! go for this if you like the herbal taste in your soup!

Freshly baked homebaked goodness by a pair of passionate and friendly couple. üë¥üëµDefinitely worth the calories and time to head over to support them. üÜôÔ∏èüÜôÔ∏è

Their crust taste like pineapple tart, really buttery.
Very delicious tarts!!üòãüòã Extremely generous amount of filling in each tarts. I am totally hooked on their tarts.

Orh Nee Tart‚úî‚úî ($1.20) - smooth, silky and natural fragrant of yam filling blended well with earthy ginkgo in the buttery crust.
Cheese Tart üßÄüßÄ($1.20) -the mixture of the acidity and richness of the cheesecake filling and buttery crust swirls well in my mouthüëçüëç
Peanut Mochi ü•úü•ú($1.20) - thick and chewy Mochi with subtle sweet yam filling. Ending with a nutty fragrance by the peanut powder coating. Well, it is a huge piece of Mochi.
.
.
Head down as early as possible to avoid dissapointment or call to book in advance. I reached down by 9.30am and only 3 types of tarts available at the moments. I consider myself lucky for the day. I am pretty sure it is a third of the price compared to those fancy artisan patisserie.

989,lowefco,Choco PBJ ($5.50),"Pullman sandwich bread baked in-house daily, with dark chocolate, jam, peanut butter and toasted almonds. I requested for the jam on the side and they obliged as this sandwich is made to order (some are premade).
As a chocolate and PB lover, I absolutely loved this sandwich.

1026,lowefco,Chocolate Cherry Tart ($5),"Tarts are usually only baked on weekends or public holidays, and I was lucky to see the Chocolate Cherry Tart and Lemon Tart on display. My eyes went straight to the chocolate tart, with a contrasting half cocoa dusted layer and the precise line of cacao nibs, it was certainly gorgeous. 
Each of the tarts are handmade, and the amount of pride and hard work that goes into them are evident. The owner, Don, shared that they were made with chocolate imported from Europe and morello cherries to give that winning bitter and sour combination. The base is also made from rye which is good for the gut, so this tart is also healthier! 
The tart base holds up very nicely, and keeps its shape without crumbling even after we sliced it into 8 pieces. It is the right thickness and the taste of the chocolate tart base is on point. The chocolate filling also holds its shape well, but remains soft to the touch and melts lusciously in your mouth. I loved the rich and slightly bitter chocolate, especially the half with the cocoa dusting. The cherries do impart a certain tartness that cuts through while complementing the bitterness, and it‚Äôs an incredibly addictive combination that I couldn‚Äôt get enough of. For a small cafe that doesn‚Äôt even specialise in making tarts, I was blown away by this chocolate tart. It‚Äôs not the most polished (I do like this exterior better than the crisp smooth tarts that many patisseries sell though), but it‚Äôs the most honest to goodness and most affordable I‚Äôve come across so far.

Two of their more popular items include the Grilled Chicken with Salted Egg Yolk ($9), an interesting combination between a grill meat with our local favourite sauce. The sauce has bits of salted egg in it which was a nice surprise, away from the generic salted egg dishes that were either too sweet or gets a bit gelat after a few bites. The only thing that I have a gripe with is the garlic rice which can be improved further as it is lacking in seasoning and flavour. On the other hand, the Smoked Suckling Pig with Glutinous Rice ($16) fared much better overall as the crispy skin on the pork was just amazing that day. Not really a big fan of glutinous rice, this got me eating quite a bit as it was nicely balanced and the addition of Chinese sausage, mushrooms and century eggs gives it a nice flavour.

1227,mona-lounge,Mona's Tea ($22).,"""At that red teahouse, we finally exchange vows"". This intimate space transports you to the glamourous period of 1980s Hong Kong with mahjong tables and cosy leather seats, but it's hidden from public view. Access can be requested at Sum Yi Tai, where you ask to see Mona and be presented with a unique code for a locked door that leads to Mona Lounge; or via reservations at drink@monalounge.com where the passcode will be provided upon confirmation.
üî∏
And this cocktail gives you a glimpse into Mona's past. The modernised Asian cocktail menu combines the expertise of Head Bartender Byron Tan and Group Chief Bartender Sam Wong. I started my cocktail journey here with this Mona‚Äôs Tea, a cognac-based cocktail made with oolong PX sherry and Fernet Branca, beautifully presented in a teacup. Served with salted egg chocolate made by Singapore‚Äôs own craft chocolatier Fossa Chocolate, the sweetness from the cognac is perfectly balanced with the bitterness of the Fernet Branca, elevated with a touch of oolong PX sherry.
üî∏
I've also tried 3 other cocktails here, as I had the lovely company of Mona Lounge owners Eu Yen and Sandra who wanted me to try a couple of their favorite drinks. I found that they are sufficiently complex yet very well balanced. This would be one of my favourite places to come for a drink after work. Moreover, the ambience here is perfect to have a drink by yourself, and it's chill enough to hold conversations with a friend.
üî∏
What a lovely place. And I wonder if I would see Mona here one day.

First, the kalguksu. The first thought that came to my mind when it was served was that I definitely overpaid for it. The soup was fairly light, without much substance to it. For the first minutes the noodles were quite chewy and had a nice mouth feel to them. However, they quickly lost their structure and became a mushy mess. The shredded chicken was also poorly integrated into the dish, and even had bones leftover in them.
Next, the naengmyeon. The noodles were rather on point. Although they looked like they were beehoon noodles, they were actually quite chewy, exactly how you expect your naengmyeon noodles to be like. However, the soup left much to be desired. It was kinda plain, and not soup enough. They do however provide you with vinegar so you can adjust to your tastes. They also provide mustard.

For the first minutes the noodles were quite chewy and had a nice mouth feel to them. However, they quickly lost their structure and became a mushy mess. The shredded chicken was also poorly integrated into the dish, and even had bones leftover in them.
Next, the naengmyeon. The noodles were rather on point. Although they looked like they were beehoon noodles, they were actually quite chewy, exactly how you expect your naengmyeon noodles to be like. However, the soup left much to be desired. It was kinda plain, and not soup enough. They do however provide you with vinegar so you can adjust to your tastes. They also provide mustard.

1401,old-hen-kitchen,Salmon and Soba,"10 Dec‚Äô17, Sun
Salmon and Soba (warm) at Old Hen Kitchen...
Moist and tender salmon with crispy skin and warm soba, tasty! Find it a little salty but otherwise, this is great!üòã
As for the portobello aglio olio, my friend had a special request to go without the bacon, the taste is good but she find it a little spicy for her...
Moving on to their drinks, their white is good too! They got their coffee beans from Nylon Coffee Roasters and the one I had is a little towards fruity taste, not bad at all!‚òïÔ∏è
As for their bottled matcha milk, I like it as it is not-that-sweet, with a hint of matcha‚Äôs bitterness, but do expect the very rich milky taste since this is a matcha MILK okay~üçµ
The open-concept kitchen allows us to have a preview of how our food is being prepared but I prefer to sit a little further away from the kitchen so as to avoid getting the smell stuck on me...üôä
Like how the cafe setting is, filled with paintings and plants (instagram props)...ü§£
The service is good, the staff served us politely with smile and making us feel welcomed! 
Not like some of the cafes which clear your plates quickly once you are done and checking you out on-and-off (that kind of pressure to hint you to leave) or might as well ask if you can give up your seats for other diners directly...
Instead of chasing us away after we are done with our meal, the staff actually replenished the bottle of plain water on our table as we chatted our time away...
Overall, for the food, coffee, ambience and service, I will be back again!
Damage: $19 (Salmon and Soba) + $19 Portobello Aglio Olio + $4.50 (White) + $7 (Bottled Matcha Milk)

Salmon and Soba (warm) at Old Hen Kitchen...
Moist and tender salmon with crispy skin and warm soba, tasty! Find it a little salty but otherwise, this is great!üòã
As for the portobello aglio olio, my friend had a special request to go without the bacon, the taste is good but she find it a little spicy for her...
Moving on to their drinks, their white is good too! They got their coffee beans from Nylon Coffee Roasters and the one I had is a little towards fruity taste, not bad at all!‚òïÔ∏è
As for their bottled matcha milk, I like it as it is not-that-sweet, with a hint of matcha‚Äôs bitterness, but do expect the very rich milky taste since this is a matcha MILK okay~üçµ
The open-concept kitchen allows us to have a preview of how our food is being prepared but I prefer to sit a little further away from the kitchen so as to avoid getting the smell stuck on me...üôä

As for their bottled matcha milk, I like it as it is not-that-sweet, with a hint of matcha‚Äôs bitterness, but do expect the very rich milky taste since this is a matcha MILK okay~üçµ
The open-concept kitchen allows us to have a preview of how our food is being prepared but I prefer to sit a little further away from the kitchen so as to avoid getting the smell stuck on me...üôä
Like how the cafe setting is, filled with paintings and plants (instagram props)...ü§£
The service is good, the staff served us politely with smile and making us feel welcomed! 
Not like some of the cafes which clear your plates quickly once you are done and checking you out on-and-off (that kind of pressure to hint you to leave) or might as well ask if you can give up your seats for other diners directly...
Instead of chasing us away after we are done with our meal, the staff actually replenished the bottle of plain water on our table as we chatted our time away...
Overall, for the food, coffee, ambience and service, I will be back again!
Damage: $19 (Salmon and Soba) + $19 Portobello Aglio Olio + $4.50 (White) + $7 (Bottled Matcha Milk)

I loved every course that was served but I believe the chu toro with shoyu foam was a unanimous favourite with the very interesting texture from the savoury foam that worked so well with the sufficiently fatty chutoro.
The other nigiri sushi were damn good too - Sea bream w truffle shoyu, shima yuzu, kanpachi, ika with sesame, torched alfonsino, akami, chu toro with shoyu foam, shime saba, torched salmon with truffle soya (which chef proclaimed will dissolve, not just melt in your mouth and it was üëçüèº!!) Also had a seemingly simple but very satisfyingly tasty sweet kani handroll with truffle, wrapped with crisp seaweed.
Not only was the seafood fresh with every element well-thought for a medley of flavours and textures in each course with seasoning done right without distracting one from the freshness, the rice is a very important part and it was done well here.

Being uni lovers, we went for the 18-course sea urchin menu.
The three bowls of starters serves to whet your appetite and awaken your taste buds as you await for the main dishes to be served.
Each of the premium sushi was carefully prepared with different seasonings that provide a different overall taste to the usual sushis in restaurants. While the ingredients enough was good enough (the fatty tuna really melts in your mouth), the seasonings kick it up a notch to bring your taste buds to different level of euphoria.
The handroll contained a generous amount of crabmeat - to the extent that I was tasting crabmeat with almost every bite!
I enjoyed the small sea urchin bowl tremendously, with its generous amount of uni mixed in with the rice (the rice grains are coated with uni!) The ikura gives that bursting goodness which prevents your taste bud from getting excessively sick (jerlat) of the same taste being repeated over and over in your mouth. Very nice touch, I must say.
And of course, who doesn‚Äôt enjoy a warm bowl of soup? The last dish to the course helps to calm down those excited tastebuds while bringing warmth and comfort to the tummy.
That was definitely 1.5 hours well-spent and well-digested. Good value for money, considering how costly omakase meals usually are and the amount of unis that were consumed that night.

The three bowls of starters serves to whet your appetite and awaken your taste buds as you await for the main dishes to be served.
Each of the premium sushi was carefully prepared with different seasonings that provide a different overall taste to the usual sushis in restaurants. While the ingredients enough was good enough (the fatty tuna really melts in your mouth), the seasonings kick it up a notch to bring your taste buds to different level of euphoria.
The handroll contained a generous amount of crabmeat - to the extent that I was tasting crabmeat with almost every bite!
I enjoyed the small sea urchin bowl tremendously, with its generous amount of uni mixed in with the rice (the rice grains are coated with uni!) The ikura gives that bursting goodness which prevents your taste bud from getting excessively sick (jerlat) of the same taste being repeated over and over in your mouth. Very nice touch, I must say.
And of course, who doesn‚Äôt enjoy a warm bowl of soup? The last dish to the course helps to calm down those excited tastebuds while bringing warmth and comfort to the tummy.
That was definitely 1.5 hours well-spent and well-digested. Good value for money, considering how costly omakase meals usually are and the amount of unis that were consumed that night.

Butter chicken, with tandoori inside mixed with butter chicken sauce. The sauce was really thick, and when you mix your garlic naan or papadum inside it makes a great combination.

The tahu telur (bottom right corner) was definitely a major highlight. Cubes of egg tofu were deep fried to a crispy golden brown and topped with a halo of deep fried egg white. It was doused with some a thick, sweet and spicy dark sauce. The combination of silky tofu and deep fried batter was heavenly. The egg white halo soaked up the sauce and turned it into dripping strings of deliciousness which I ate like noodles. And that delightfully savory sauce coated everything with its perfect balance of sweetness and tanginess. 
Another highlight was their signature fried chicken (top right corner). Served piping hot, the strong whiff of Indonesian spices shone through with every bite. The breast meat was not dry but instead tore apart easily, and the meat inside glistened with chicken juice. I was so impressed because it wasn't the least bit oily despite its delightful crispiness.
Finally, their chendol which (not pictured here) finished off our delicious meal with a bang. Served with coconut milk and gula melaka with bits of sago spooned into the bottom, it was sweet, rich and the perfect respite from Singapore's heat.

The tahu telur (bottom right corner) was definitely a major highlight. Cubes of egg tofu were deep fried to a crispy golden brown and topped with a halo of deep fried egg white. It was doused with some a thick, sweet and spicy dark sauce. The combination of silky tofu and deep fried batter was heavenly. The egg white halo soaked up the sauce and turned it into dripping strings of deliciousness which I ate like noodles. And that delightfully savory sauce coated everything with its perfect balance of sweetness and tanginess. 
Another highlight was their signature fried chicken (top right corner). Served piping hot, the strong whiff of Indonesian spices shone through with every bite. The breast meat was not dry but instead tore apart easily, and the meat inside glistened with chicken juice. I was so impressed because it wasn't the least bit oily despite its delightful crispiness.

1960,the-wine-gourmet-friends,[The Wine & Gourmet Friends] - Foie Gras Lotus Rice ($18).,"Foie Gras and rice to me is an unusual combination but the chemistry between these two ingredients was better than expected. Perhaps the idea came from replacing liver with foie gras (just guessing), the role of foie gras in the rice was like that of a stir-fried pork liver but with an additional creamy texture. It was seared to attain a slight crisp on its surface, which released a layer of sweet gaminess into the savoury rice. Being the centerpiece of a dish usually, it did not steal any limelight from the lotus leaf rice, which was just as outstanding on its own. Fragrant with oriental seasoning and condiments, Calrose rice is used instead of glutinous rice to lighten the load from your stomach. Glutinous rice would certainly be too soft and sweet for this dish to succeed. I love the chopped porcini and shiitake mushrooms, and the Chinese X.O. sausage which added another dimension of flavours and texture. The fried lotus chips were not necessary, as they turned greasy towards the end.

1962,the-wine-gourmet-friends,[The Wine & Gourmet Friends] - Foie Gras Lotus Rice ($18).,"Foie Gras and rice to me is an unusual combination but the chemistry between these two ingredients was better than expected. Perhaps the idea came from replacing liver with foie gras (just guessing), the role of foie gras in the rice was like that of a stir-fried pork liver but with an additional creamy texture. It was seared to attain a slight crisp on its surface, which released a layer of sweet gaminess into the savoury rice. Being the centerpiece of a dish usually, it did not steal any limelight from the lotus leaf rice, which was just as outstanding on its own. Fragrant with oriental seasoning and condiments, Calrose rice is used instead of glutinous rice to lighten the load from your stomach. Glutinous rice would certainly be too soft and sweet for this dish to succeed. I love the chopped porcini and shiitake mushrooms, and the Chinese X.O. sausage which added another dimension of flavours and texture. The fried lotus chips were not necessary, as they turned greasy towards the end.
