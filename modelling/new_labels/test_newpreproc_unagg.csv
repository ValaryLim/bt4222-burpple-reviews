The Pappardelle was really good. Pasta was a little softer than Al dente, the way I like it. And it was flavourful with a good amount of mushroom. However I felt like I couldn't taste the beef so I'm not sure if they minced it such that I couldn't really get the meat texture.
The spaghetti had a good kick to it from the chilli crab. It was also creamy yet not too overwhelmingly so. It was my favourite dish from here.

One of the items we managed to try was the Beef Bulgogi Dosirak (도시락) Lunch Box ($9.90). Looking similar to lunch boxes that parents would usually pack for their kids, the metal tin box contains steamed rice, a sunny side egg, a side of beef bulgogi, kimchi & seaweed!
How it usually is consumed is to close the tin box, shake up the ingredients to have a good mix & you're ready to eat!
If it feels too messy to eat it that way, you can have it as it is, pilling the ingredients on your spoon before consuming.
Apart from Dosirak, you'd be able to find jjigae, fried chicken, kimbap & ramyeon available too! I'll be sharing more in an upcoming post soon.

.","The iced Sikhye ($2.50) offered a light refreshing sweetness at the beginning of each mouthful and we enjoyed how the rice fragrance would slowly dissipate at the back of our throats when we swallowed it. Also, the residues of cooked rice added an interesting texture to the drink.
.
Also, we got the Budae Jigae Ramyeon ($9.90). The ramyeon came in a pretty big bowl and consist of standard army stew ingredients like sausage, luncheon meat, tofu and fishcakes which were all pretty tasty. However, the crux to this dish was the soup base which we thought could be more savoury and that spiciness could be down a notch as well. Another issue was that the noodles was overcooked and tasted slightly soggy.
.
We also ordered the Chap Chae + Soy Chicken Dosirak ($9.90) that came in a rectangular metal box. This dish was right up our alley. The soya sauce chicken was very tender and savoury while the chap chae provided an added sesame fragrance. It felt like we were eating both rice and noodles at the same time due to the glass noodles in the chap chae. Add a piece of kimchi and a piece of egg to each spoonful of this rice mixture for an extra palatable bite!
.
The final item that we got was the 6 pieces Fried Chicken ($7.90) that came in a mix of wingettes and drumettes. There are two flavours to choose from: spicy and soy, and you are allowed to mix the flavours. The chicken was very tender on the inside and was mildly crispy on the outside as the sauce had seeped into the skin, making it less crunchy but more flavourful. Both of us concurred that the soy chicken tasted better than its spicy counterpart as the spicy sauce was rather overwhelming, drawing our attention away from the meat itself.

However, the crux to this dish was the soup base which we thought could be more savoury and that spiciness could be down a notch as well. Another issue was that the noodles was overcooked and tasted slightly soggy.
.
We also ordered the Chap Chae + Soy Chicken Dosirak ($9.90) that came in a rectangular metal box. This dish was right up our alley. The soya sauce chicken was very tender and savoury while the chap chae provided an added sesame fragrance. It felt like we were eating both rice and noodles at the same time due to the glass noodles in the chap chae. Add a piece of kimchi and a piece of egg to each spoonful of this rice mixture for an extra palatable bite!
.
The final item that we got was the 6 pieces Fried Chicken ($7.90) that came in a mix of wingettes and drumettes. There are two flavours to choose from: spicy and soy, and you are allowed to mix the flavours. The chicken was very tender on the inside and was mildly crispy on the outside as the sauce had seeped into the skin, making it less crunchy but more flavourful. Both of us concurred that the soy chicken tasted better than its spicy counterpart as the spicy sauce was rather overwhelming, drawing our attention away from the meat itself.

Also, we got the Budae Jigae Ramyeon ($9.90). The ramyeon came in a pretty big bowl and consist of standard army stew ingredients like sausage, luncheon meat, tofu and fishcakes which were all pretty tasty. However, the crux to this dish was the soup base which we thought could be more savoury and that spiciness could be down a notch as well. Another issue was that the noodles was overcooked and tasted slightly soggy.
.
We also ordered the Chap Chae + Soy Chicken Dosirak ($9.90) that came in a rectangular metal box. This dish was right up our alley. The soya sauce chicken was very tender and savoury while the chap chae provided an added sesame fragrance. It felt like we were eating both rice and noodles at the same time due to the glass noodles in the chap chae. Add a piece of kimchi and a piece of egg to each spoonful of this rice mixture for an extra palatable bite!
.
The final item that we got was the 6 pieces Fried Chicken ($7.90) that came in a mix of wingettes and drumettes. There are two flavours to choose from: spicy and soy, and you are allowed to mix the flavours. The chicken was very tender on the inside and was mildly crispy on the outside as the sauce had seeped into the skin, making it less crunchy but more flavourful. Both of us concurred that the soy chicken tasted better than its spicy counterpart as the spicy sauce was rather overwhelming, drawing our attention away from the meat itself.

Indeed there were like 3 very fresh prawns and about 25pcs of clams! Wow such generosity and mind you, these are Japanese Asari Clams and damn sweet! I can only say to those customers who don't like many clams is:
1. Order other options!
2. Ask for lesser clams to prevent wastage! Remember must #worldcleanplate!
3. Don't even comment if you have nothing else to say lah... No one will blame you one trust me.

357,deannas-kitchen,"Gf haven't tried this so I specially brought her to this 'Sumami' Halal Prawn Noodles place at Toa Payoh, which opened about 4 months ago (https://eatwithroy.com/2017/06/09/deannas-kitchen-toa-payoh-singapore/)
•
I read someone commenting that there are just too many clams in their bowl of Prawn Noodles with Clams ($6.50).","So I ordered to try. Indeed there were like 3 very fresh prawns and about 25pcs of clams! Wow such generosity and mind you, these are Japanese Asari Clams and damn sweet! I can only say to those customers who don't like many clams is:
1. Order other options!
2. Ask for lesser clams to prevent wastage! Remember must #worldcleanplate!
3. Don't even comment if you have nothing else to say lah... No one will blame you one trust me.

Ok come support younger hawkerpreneurs ya!

Here, suckling pigs are spit-roasted daily behind the shop, and coated in a marinade made from a family recipe.
.
The pork meat is tender and moist, with good smoky sweet savoury salty flavour. The skin is wonderfully crisp, with a herbal note from the marinade (I detect at least garlic, lemongrass, and light soy sauce), and crunches loudly when bit.
.
I understand each suckling pig is spit-roasted over wood charcoal for 4 hours, and regularly basted in its own juices. Fresh and succulent, with a balanced ratio of pork meat to fat.
.
No wonder they draw a queue each night. Some buy kilo's to takeaway!.

The chicken wing is a runaway winner. Super love the crispy skin yet juicy flesh. The sambal tasted a little burnt which was kinda disappointing.

526,four-seasons-cendol,Four Seasons Cendol is commonly recognized by many to serve the best cendol in Singapore.,"Other than an outlet at Toa Payoh Lor 8, I just discovered a branch at Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 Food Centre.
Keep your expectations high when you visit this place for a rich and creamy bowl of sugary delight.
Every bowl is prepared on order and swiftly put together within a minute so you don’t have to wait too long. It is exceptionally tasty and the presentation is also Instagram worthy (shoot your photos fast in this hot weather though). I got myself a bowl of Cendol for $2.20. The bowls already have attap seeds and red beans, filled up with thick green jelly and ice shavings in a perfect dome of deliciousness.

Unfortunately, the soup was also disappointing - thought the flavour would be amazing with all the seafood, but it tasted like maggi mee soup. Is that why they serve it without spoons? Because the soup isn't worth drinking?
Heard that Captain K is better - haven't been there but I would now like to try.
Side dishes come before your main dishes do. These were very ordinary..... Not like the amazing Korean restaurant side dishes I am used to.

The pork chop ($6.50) complements well with the mushroom sauce & the tomato base spaghetti. You get to choose between 3 spaghetti bases: Cream, tomato & mushroom. The mushroom soup is really good also and it's only $1.50!

An surprise finding by the food tour led by @eileenongxt. Opened by two lovely couple at year 2008 but serving up taste which tasted like they had been around for decades. Started without recipe, they did trial and error till their satisfaction. .
|
In their bowl of mixed beef soup (S$4.50), we could find a generous amount of their braised brisket and tripe. By its look, I mistaken that it was a Vietnamese style beef style but the taste was totally different. Good crisp from the onion and bean spout contrast with the tender brisket. My guess is the owners slowly simmered the broth with the brisket and bones for its translucent appearance then seasoned with soy sauce. .
|
Another of my favorite would be their braised Tendons ($6.50 - minimum amount). Easily melted in the mouth texture which only be achieved after hours of braised. The sauce had a strong soy sauce taste which might not be everyone liking. Best with a bowl of white rice. .

An surprise finding by the food tour led by @eileenongxt. Opened by two lovely couple at year 2008 but serving up taste which tasted like they had been around for decades. Started without recipe, they did trial and error till their satisfaction. .
|
In their bowl of mixed beef soup (S$4.50), we could find a generous amount of their braised brisket and tripe. By its look, I mistaken that it was a Vietnamese style beef style but the taste was totally different. Good crisp from the onion and bean spout contrast with the tender brisket. My guess is the owners slowly simmered the broth with the brisket and bones for its translucent appearance then seasoned with soy sauce. .
|
Another of my favorite would be their braised Tendons ($6.50 - minimum amount). Easily melted in the mouth texture which only be achieved after hours of braised. The sauce had a strong soy sauce taste which might not be everyone liking. Best with a bowl of white rice. .

Celebrated National Day yesterday by trying Singapore’s very own “National Cake”.","Back in school, my friends used to dub the Pandan Cake as every Singaporean’s favourite childhood cake and it’s not hard to see why with Joe & Doe’s Gula Melaka Pandan Cake.
You’ll find everything that you’ll look for in a Pandan cake in this one - soft, adequately sweet, thick Pandan fragrance, soft and moist, not to mention that it will be made hot to serve upon ordering...need I say more?? Coupled with a bittersweet coconut hot chocolate cuppa and my National Day break is complete😘

938,kim-peng-hiang,"Pineapple Barbecue Pork Bak Kwa (SGD $24 per 500g, $48 per 1kg) @ Kim Peng Hiang.","This unique CNY delicacy is nearly double the thickness of regular bak kwa, making it more moist with a nicer chew to texture.
Blending with pineapple (you can see the chunks) makes the meat more tender, and imparts a fruit caramelised sweetness, complementing the savoury salty flavour of the pork.

950,kizuna-1,Mini Croissant for Two - Egg Mayo & Slipper Lobster Mayo ($7.80++),"New cafe at Potong Pasir | Love the space and ambience at this new little hideout. Menu was pretty interesting as well with several unique items, one of which was their selection of croissants. Went for the Slipper Lobster Mayo which was really refreshing with its zesty marination, topped with tobiko bits.
Do note that spaces (4-5 tables) are limited on the weekends, especially with the current safe distancing measures and since it's a relatively new cafe. Will definitely be back!

We had the Open Mushroom $20, deep fried zucchini $12, fried chicken $20 and countless of drinks. Dishes were in huge portion that definitely could serve up to 3-4pax.

Super love the injeolmi bingsu, they were super generous with their toppings!! Shaved ice was soft and fluffy and it wasn't overly sweet! The chocolate toast which they recommended came with a huge mountain of whip cream (I never liked whip cream) and I was kinda turned off by it.... But i gotta be honest, it doesn't taste as bad as I thought it would. The toast was crispy and buttery and a little whip cream actually goes well with it. Tastes like ice cream with toast actually. The Injeolmi toast was da bomb - buttery, crispy, sticky chewy rice cakes and a generous amount of soybean powder. And there's dried cranberries !!! (not too sure if it's me, but I usually don't think there's dried cranberries in Injeolmi toast?) Yummmz. All those for $23.10? There's a 10% opening discount off everything. Super worth it!!!

📍 @nunsaram_cafe is now a one stop cafe where you can get both your savoury favourites such as Gimbap and Tteokbokki, as well as your sweet treats! 😃😃
—
The Special Tteokbokki ($14.90) right at the front features original tteokbokki, 2 fried seaweed rolls, 2 fried dumplings 🥟 and half a normal portion of gimbap. Oh, of course with a dollop of stretchy cheese 🧀 right at the top for you to do your perfect cheese pull 😉! With a single 🌶 sign out of a maximum of two, it’s perfect for those of you who love your spice! For those who don’t (and eat beef 🥩) I’d definitely recommend the Bulgogi Tteokbokki ($9.90)! It’s extremely addictive with each piece of chewy rice cake coated with a viscous layer of bulgogi sauce which is slightly salty and has a sweet aftertaste to it 🤤

Pat Bingsu [$12.90]
Shaved ice was sufficiently fine.
Topped with red beans, toasted almonds, peanut powder & rice cakes, its taste wasn't great enough to overpower the thought at the back of everyone's minds that Bing Go Jung's version is bigger AND cheaper.
Oreo Bingsu [$12.90]
Little variety in its one-note flavour profile, which tasted like it was almost tailored for a child's palate.
Chocolate Banana Bingsu [$15.90]
It tasted the best out of the three, only by virtue that I like bananas lol.
What should I try instead?
Milk & Red Bean [$11.00]

It is probably the most intense in prawny-ness (had to invent a word to do this justice) I have ever come across, and what’s more, it feels shockingly silky in the mouth and not at all greasy.
Owned and run by ex-colleagues (Chef Gwyneth and Chef Kun use to work together at @burntends_sg), One Prawn Noodle sells prawn noodles with different toppings. Prices start at $5 for a “Sliced Pork and Prawn” and goes up to $8 for the “Abalone and Prawn”. What I find interesting is the menu of add-ons they offer which lists the parts of a pig: lean meat, skin, intestines, tail and ribs, as well as novel items such as beancurd skin rolls (it is the same kind as you get at #BeautyInAPot and is brilliant dunked in the broth), prawn balls, abalone, vegetables and a whole egg. Despite this, there’s no denying it is their hypnotically rich-to-the-point-of-opaqueness broth that is the be-all and end-all. So the commonsensical thing to do is to order the soup version, right? However, what if I told you that the dry-style is the one I think you should get? You see, this pair of young hawkers make their own sambal chilli too and it is astonishingly tasty. When noodles are tossed in that savoury spiciness, the strands become aromatic and mouthwateringly shiok. To pair, you get a big packet of the magical prawn broth. See? Their dry version really lets you enjoy the best of both worlds 😄.

Le dad said don’t eat first, wait for all the food to be served and you can take photo~😬
Le mum then tried to take a flatlay after seeing you taking one...🤣
- Deep Fried Fish in Black Sauce 油浸魚🐟
- Venison with Ginger & Spring Onion 姜蔥鹿肉🍖
- Sambal Kang Kong 馬來風光
- Hor Fun 河粉
Recommend their deep fried fish! Super duper crispy and the sauce goes really very well with rice!
The venison with ginger & spring onion is also another nice dish, the ginger got rid of the meat smell and the meat is really tender, like!
Sambal kang kong, nothing to pick, decent...
As for the hor fun, find it a bit too sticky, n find tt like no wok-hei, so-so only...
Damage: $85

Was very satisfied with these steamed freshly on the spot. Had to wait 5 mins for these to be ready, but it was worth it.
I lunched here during an off-peak hour, so there was only 1 person in front of me in the queue. Normally, during peak hour there is a long line at this stall!
The XLBs had very umami soup inside, & the skin is of the thickness & softness that it should be. It doesn't break easily either, so there's little to no soup wastage due to accidents.
The dumplings were filled with lots of meat, which delights me. Very value for money. The same can be said about the skin here too.
I also like how you help yourself to the ginger & vinegar at the stall, because I generally eat a mountain of ginger & less vinegar than the average person. So I can #optimize, here. 
I immediately bought some frozen ones to bring home & steam when I need a quick fix for a meal. They come in bags of 10 each - $6.50 per bag of XLB, $4.50 per bag of dumplings. Pretty competitive pricing for such excellent quality!

1629,shanghai-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,My Favourite Dumplings,"上海拉面小笼包 Shanghai La Mian Xiao Long Bao at Alexandra Village Food Centre (#01-56) sells lovely Dumplings 水饺 ($5.00 for 10) & Xiao Long Baos 小笼包 ($5.00 for 7). Was very satisfied with these steamed freshly on the spot. Had to wait 5 mins for these to be ready, but it was worth it.
I lunched here during an off-peak hour, so there was only 1 person in front of me in the queue. Normally, during peak hour there is a long line at this stall!
The XLBs had very umami soup inside, & the skin is of the thickness & softness that it should be. It doesn't break easily either, so there's little to no soup wastage due to accidents.
The dumplings were filled with lots of meat, which delights me. Very value for money. The same can be said about the skin here too.

A reasonably sized, soft, fluffy bun ($1.60) with raisins and walnuts embedded into it. It's sweet from the raisins with an interesting crunchy texture and earthiness from the walnuts. Wish they were more generous with the toppings but it's something I can look past. :)

Went down on the weekend, thinking that I could use Burpple Beyond (BB) but was told that it’s only available during weekdays. This info should have been stated clearly in the deal’s details (which it wasn’t) so that low SES ppl like me can save my trip down and pick another BB restaurant instead 😐 
Had the Smoked Salmon & Egg Waffle($17.90, pictured), Spicy Carbonara Pasta ($15.90) & Forage Signature Drink ($8.50). The Waffle was unique, well-crafted and good value for money. The portion was pretty huge as well. The pasta was a disappointment as it’s just mediocre. Don’t think that the price is justifiable as I have had better and cheaper Carbonara at 5 Senses Bistro (not a sponsored ad lol). The Drink was only 3/4 full from the mason jar which looks like someone drank a huge mouthful before it was served to us 🤔 But reading from other ppl’s review, i think that is just their serving style, which is quite weird? The Drink was meh and not worth the price.

.","I have been exploring food at One North recently and found this place on Burpple!
.
The food here didn’t disappoint. I had the salad option, which includes one main and 2 sides. I chose the salmon with purple potato and broccoli with a small glass kombucha. I enjoyed the thick slice of salmon and the sweet mashed purple potato! I am not a big fan of the kombucha but no complaints since it came with the set.
.
Overall, it’s a hearty healthy meal and I will definitely be back when I am in need of a detox from all the fried food.

Besides that, diners can also enjoy great local flavours with dishes such as
• 💕 Salt Pepper Crispy Shrimps with Curry Leaves. ($14.80).
• 💕Wok-fried King Prawn White Bee Hoon. ($18.80).
• 💕Tiger-Infused Crispy Baby Sotong. ($15.80).

My fav dish is the salt pepper crispy shrimps with curry leaves. Pair it with Shiok ale (seasonal brew from Tiger Beer, a tropical medley of passionfruit and pineapples). It’s so shiok, I couldn’t stop!

Besides that, diners can also enjoy great local flavours with dishes such as
• 💕 Salt Pepper Crispy Shrimps with Curry Leaves. ($14.80).
• 💕Wok-fried King Prawn White Bee Hoon. ($18.80).
• 💕Tiger-Infused Crispy Baby Sotong. ($15.80).
• 💕Pickled Garlic Fried Barramundi Fillet. ($18.80).
My fav dish is the salt pepper crispy shrimps with curry leaves. Pair it with Shiok ale (seasonal brew from Tiger Beer, a tropical medley of passionfruit and pineapples). It’s so shiok, I couldn’t stop!

1995,tiong-bahru-lee-hong-kee-cantonese-roasted,One of the several Cantonese roasts in Tiong Bahru Market but is this supposedly the more famous one?,"It falls short of expectations as the char siew was a major letdown for me, the meat was slightly tough and it has a slight porky odour. Maybe it’s just a one-off thing and the pigs were having an off day. The roasted pork on the other hand fared much better for its fat to meat ratio and nicely charred skin. Anyone else has tried from this stall before and if it’s any good or just overly hyped? However, I must say that the portions were generous though.

Another must-try is their Grilled Moo Ping ($5.90/3pcs). Grilled minced pork that has fats in it to give that sweet patty the omph juicy bites.

Spicy level 3 and Sour level 2, this claypot has definitely level up our favourite thai tomyum MAMA noodles.","To justify the price, this comes with crab claw meat, prawn, clam, squid, minced pork and the mandatory egg. So good that we ordered a second round. Not enough for 2pax to share la! 🤣
.
Another must-try is their Grilled Moo Ping ($5.90/3pcs). Grilled minced pork that has fats in it to give that sweet patty the omph juicy bites. Pretty reasonable priced side dishes ranging from $3.90-$5.90 generally. Not forgetting thai milktea and greentea ($2.90 each). Try the Jumbo-sized milktea ($12.90) if you have the stomach space to. My advice: just go for regular-sized ones and order different flavours.

We save this place in a wishlist for some time in @burpple app. This lunch we visit the place at noon (just in time before the crowd 😇).
.
The jazz music with the retro Art Deco & musical instruments really transport us back in time. We felt so relaxed like we were in a kopi place but we are here for their Nasi Padang!! 😜
.
Get 2 vege, 1 meat for each set. First time trying chicken rendang and it's so delicious! Highly addictive tapioca leaves in mild spicy curry goes well with bergedil (potato croquette). Sambal goreng is also pretty good. The gravy pour on top of rice gives a little kick to each set. Somehow we feel that we can eat more though. If they give us more rice, we would definitely order extra Tahu Telur to share! 😅
.
Quite common to some Nasi Padang stalls, there is no bill breakdown. We paid $15.5 for 2 sets (including tea). Such a good & reasonable eat in SG that is definitely worthwhile your visit in Orchard. 🍛

*****
We save this place in a wishlist for some time in @burpple app. This lunch we visit the place at noon (just in time before the crowd 😇).
.
The jazz music with the retro Art Deco & musical instruments really transport us back in time. We felt so relaxed like we were in a kopi place but we are here for their Nasi Padang!! 😜
.
Get 2 vege, 1 meat for each set. First time trying chicken rendang and it's so delicious! Highly addictive tapioca leaves in mild spicy curry goes well with bergedil (potato croquette). Sambal goreng is also pretty good. The gravy pour on top of rice gives a little kick to each set. Somehow we feel that we can eat more though. If they give us more rice, we would definitely order extra Tahu Telur to share! 😅
.
Quite common to some Nasi Padang stalls, there is no bill breakdown. We paid $15.5 for 2 sets (including tea). Such a good & reasonable eat in SG that is definitely worthwhile your visit in Orchard. 🍛

They have so many choices to try.
I tried beef gepuk (meat with red chilli), beef rendang, and always with cassava leaves for my nasi padang. Everything taste nice but not the best actually.
The meat lil bit hard for me.
The ‘bakwan’ (veggie fritters) also looks so big and tempting but it turns out too much flour, but again tastewise it’s not bad.
Not forget to order Tea bottled too and our lunch is perfect 👌

2161,yishun-park-hawker-centre,|🥘 Chilli Paste really saved the Hokkien Mee 。...,"~
·
Hokkien Mee - $4
·
Their hokkien mee is moist but not that flavourful by itself. However with their chilli is a different story all together. Their chilli paste is sweet sour spicy all at once, giving the Hokkien Mee a boost in flavours. Then there are the standard ingredients such as prawn, squid and pork slices, which are quite acceptable. Just a warning, there’s a lot of garlic bits in the dish, which I enjoyed, while some people may not. Hear say their Fried Kway Teow is quite a popular choice too

The fries, not as fantastic. The seaweed flakes does not stick to the fries so most of the time they gather at the bottom of the pocket. I ended up pouring the fries over the chicken so that the seaweed will stick to the chicken eventually.

Definitely wasn't expecting this long a wait on a weekday at 3PM.
Reason? It all started with the guy taking orders. He gave us a number tag different from the order number he written down in their system. It was off-peak hours and we were the 3rd group of customers. Those before us received their fried rice. And then the many groups after us all got theirs too. Our order number never got called. 
When we enquired at the counter, another guy asked for our order tag, looked at their order sheet, and then nonchalantly said they must have gotten our order number wrong. I informed him we had ordered 25 mins ago, long before the other groups arrived. There was no apology. Just a shrug.

Review 💬: Have been wanting to try Tuk Tuk Cha’s shibuya toasts for awhile as they are pretty affordable compared to others like Dazzling Cafe’s. Opted for the thai milk tea flavour as I wanted something which was not as common. The portion was just nice for 2-3 in my opinion. The toast was a little off to me, although I could not quite put a finger on it. Maybe it was too buttery (which made it taste overly greasy) or the edges were not as crispy as I would have liked, but as an entire, it was not bad. Would not go back just for the shibuya toast, but if I’m in the area and craving for something sweet, I would not mind getting it again.

Stopped by this stall @chinatownmarket and spotted the tray of glistening glutinous rice that was too hard to pass up on. Also available were the traditional yam cake, chee cheong fun, soon kueh and png kueh. The glutinous rice was decent but couldn’t compare with this fluffy version i had eons ago from a different stall at the same hawker centre. The latter had closed due to the stall owner’s old age with nobody to take over and thus an excellent recipe was lost. Yam cake here is of a firm texture. I prefer wobbly kind from childhood days.",Jayson Yeo,@Jasonyeo,food,soon kueh png,0.0,food,,soon kueh png,soon kueh png

499,workbench-bistro,Egg Lava Beef Burger,"Said to be the trending item in TWB's menu is this Egg Lava Beef Burger (S$16.90), which features a beef patty, crispy bacon, melted cheese and a lava egg in the middle of the patty. Comes with a generous serving of paprika fries.
You can't hold the burger up with your hands, unless you are prepared to rush for the tap to clean up the mess. Even if you just needed an excuse to lick your fingers after the meal, be prepared that the beef patty, because of the opening to rest the egg, did not stick glue together very well somehow. In fact, they probably mixed too much herbs (rosemary, I believe) into the patty and that did not score for me.
The meal was definitely very filling, whatsmore with a generous serving of fries. On the other hand, TWB has other better options for me to call it a satisfying meal.

I would like to credit my Bread Clan for this photo because obviously I cannot finish all 3 dishes by myself.","I had the Salted Egg Chicken Pasta so let me focus on that.
It’s my first every salted egg pasta but I have nothing to compare it to. But still I felt that it was pretty well done; the salted egg sauce was blended very well with the pasta. And it was more of a dry sauce rather than the extremely SEY sauce that I have tasted elsewhere. So thankfully it didn’t overpower the pasta and leave you with the need to take a sip of water with every mouthful of pasta.",Wrigg Linggg,@wrigglinggg,food,extremely sey,0.0,,,extremely sey,extrem sey
530,109-teochew-yong-tau-foo,Ampang YTF!,"Along Circular Road, you'll spot this snaking queue for 109's ytf! Don't be intimidated by the long queue cos it moves fairly fast.
Pick minimum 6 pieces and tell them how you want your ytf to be done - soup, dry and laksa. They also sell fried rice and fried chicken wings! Do note that their dry version isn't your usual dry ytf, drowned in sweet and chili sauces. Theirs is ladened with a light brown gravy, looking really similar to that of lormee! 
The gravy is savoury and rich in taste, but not overly salty! It's smooth (no clumps of starch) and not very thick. I could sip on it! It coats every strand of my kwaytiao so perfectly. Usually kwaytiao clumps into a huge mess in such gooey base. But guess what? I could pick up each strand of my noodles, slurping them up happily. THE GRAVY AND KWAYTIAO IS LIKE A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN! ❤ 
Their tofu tastes fresh (both the square and triangle ones) and soft. I'm loving this place and i can't wait to visit them again. *TIP* they've seats available on the 2nd storey! airconditioned 😉

590,workspace,Was craving for a grain bowl ($12) from workspace espresso!,"Trying this for the second time. Ordered the same ingredients as the last time (green tea soba, roasted sweet potato, sous vide egg, wakame mushroom salad), except that I got the baked tilipia fish and lent chips this time round! Opted for the miso ginger sauce as well. But beats me why the sauce was poured over the lent chips?! Since my order was a takeaway, by the time it reached home, the lent chips were soggy and not crispy anymore? I also had to scrap off the sauce so that it can be on my green tea soba instead. And I need to remind myself for the next order that the wakame mushroom salad is 99% wakame, and only less than 1% of mushrooms (there were only less than 5 small pieces of mushroom)! It was only after I bought it did I remember the CNA video a few weeks back talking about how cold food have more bacteria and should be consumed faster.

598,workspace,Was craving for a grain bowl ($12) from workspace espresso!,"Trying this for the second time. Ordered the same ingredients as the last time (green tea soba, roasted sweet potato, sous vide egg, wakame mushroom salad), except that I got the baked tilipia fish and lent chips this time round! Opted for the miso ginger sauce as well. But beats me why the sauce was poured over the lent chips?! Since my order was a takeaway, by the time it reached home, the lent chips were soggy and not crispy anymore? I also had to scrap off the sauce so that it can be on my green tea soba instead. And I need to remind myself for the next order that the wakame mushroom salad is 99% wakame, and only less than 1% of mushrooms (there were only less than 5 small pieces of mushroom)! It was only after I bought it did I remember the CNA video a few weeks back talking about how cold food have more bacteria and should be consumed faster.

678,omusg,"Curry Sauce Omurice with Pork Cutlets ($13.80), Add On $2 For Lava Egg","Expect a long queue at Omu with such instagrammable lava egg rice! The last order for lunch was at 2.30pm and they supposedly reopen at 4pm but the queue started forming at 3.20pm. Eventually when they opened at 4.10pm, the small restaurant was quickly fully occupied. 
Decided on this curry sauce omurice with pork cutlets which was one of the recommended. Unlike the usual Japanese curry that I have tried, this tend to be more salty and watery rather than the thick slightly sweet curry. The butter fried rice was average.

703,omusg,"This green omurice ($14.80++) is part of @omusg christmas menu, available for a limited time only!","If you thought the green is made from matcha (like me at first), you thought wrong HAHA! It's actually supposed to be spinach, although the taste of spinach was very slight in the omelette. The lack of a spinach taste aside, I do like the rest of the dish very much. You can choose to have the omelette paired with entirely tomato or cream sauce or like I did, a mix of both. But either way both sauces are great; the tomato sauce wasn't overly tangy and the cream sauce well...i think some will say it tastes like mushroom soup but it's still enjoyable nonetheless 😂 Also, the tomato sauce comes with eggplants and mushrooms while the cream sauce has mushrooms and bacon bits. by default, tomato rice is included inside the omelette but you could choose to switch to butter rice for an additional $1. I chose not to and still liked the tomato rice either way. There's also some pork slices in the omlette as well

But either way both sauces are great; the tomato sauce wasn't overly tangy and the cream sauce well...i think some will say it tastes like mushroom soup but it's still enjoyable nonetheless 😂 Also, the tomato sauce comes with eggplants and mushrooms while the cream sauce has mushrooms and bacon bits. by default, tomato rice is included inside the omelette but you could choose to switch to butter rice for an additional $1. I chose not to and still liked the tomato rice either way. There's also some pork slices in the omlette as well

You don't see me eating tendon very often, if at all for the past year. I've tried both Tendon Ginza Itsuki and Tendon Kohaku a few times, but I'm not a big fan of how oily and salty they can get.
🔸
The tempura that I like would have have light, thin, airy batter that's crispy but not oily. I prefer no sauce drenched over them, but instead like it to be served with some salt on the side. Mizuki serves this type of tempura which I like.
🔸
Between the $80 lunch set and $100 lunch set, go for the $100. Because for $20 more, not only do you get 11 pieces of tempura instead of 9, you'll get slightly better ingredients for the first 9 pieces too.

The rice that comes with this is sushi rice, and so everything tasted like a bowl of sushi feast. I like to spread the wasabi over the seafood without any shoyu sauce, so that adds more kick to the meal.
