Review üí¨: Have been wanting to try Tuk Tuk Cha‚Äôs shibuya toasts for awhile as they are pretty affordable compared to others like Dazzling Cafe‚Äôs. Opted for the thai milk tea flavour as I wanted something which was not as common. The portion was just nice for 2-3 in my opinion. The toast was a little off to me, although I could not quite put a finger on it. Maybe it was too buttery (which made it taste overly greasy) or the edges were not as crispy as I would have liked, but as an entire, it was not bad. Would not go back just for the shibuya toast, but if I‚Äôm in the area and craving for something sweet, I would not mind getting it again.

The toast was a little off to me, although I could not quite put a finger on it. Maybe it was too buttery (which made it taste overly greasy) or the edges were not as crispy as I would have liked, but as an entire, it was not bad. Would not go back just for the shibuya toast, but if I‚Äôm in the area and craving for something sweet, I would not mind getting it again.

You can't hold the burger up with your hands, unless you are prepared to rush for the tap to clean up the mess. Even if you just needed an excuse to lick your fingers after the meal, be prepared that the beef patty, because of the opening to rest the egg, did not stick glue together very well somehow. In fact, they probably mixed too much herbs (rosemary, I believe) into the patty and that did not score for me.
The meal was definitely very filling, whatsmore with a generous serving of fries. On the other hand, TWB has other better options for me to call it a satisfying meal.

Even if you just needed an excuse to lick your fingers after the meal, be prepared that the beef patty, because of the opening to rest the egg, did not stick glue together very well somehow. In fact, they probably mixed too much herbs (rosemary, I believe) into the patty and that did not score for me.
The meal was definitely very filling, whatsmore with a generous serving of fries. On the other hand, TWB has other better options for me to call it a satisfying meal.

Since my order was a takeaway, by the time it reached home, the lent chips were soggy and not crispy anymore? I also had to scrap off the sauce so that it can be on my green tea soba instead.

Between the $80 lunch set and $100 lunch set, go for the $100. Because for $20 more, not only do you get 11 pieces of tempura instead of 9, you'll get slightly better ingredients for the first 9 pieces too.

High class carbonara with some black truffle! Unfortunately, the main was not good as the food at the appetiser and dessert buffet.

The waffles were thin and a little hard, nothing extraordinary. Personally disliked the way they flooded the waffles with chocolate and whipped cream thus making it a little soggy. Although it satisfied my sweet cravings, would not recommend if sweet and sugary desserts are not up your alley.
The service on the other hand was disappointing as well. We were showed to a cold seat, under the aircon. When asked to change seats, the waitresses gave us a stare and were extremely unpleasant.

685,cafe-de-muse,Pumpkin Pasta [$24.05],"Chanced upon this new Korean cafe (with some Korean waitstaff), Cafe De Muse, on the ground floor of Isetan at Shaw Centre in Orchard. 
The pasta was piping hot, waited maybe 15 minutes for it. Came with pumpkin puree and basil (I think) and sun dried tomatoes (vegetarian option I believe). Kind of like baby food! It‚Äôs alright. I was wondering why there was no tomato based pasta on the menu and they informed me that they are gonna be adding that. Right now there‚Äôs squid ink, carbonara, prawn aglio olio and the pumpkin pasta.
There were a number of customers in the cafe, groups of people as well as people working on their computers.
Might try their bingsu next time, they have a number of flavours like Oreo, rice cake (or rice powder), brownie, cheesecake, green tea, melon, strawberry, and more. They also appear to sell their own brand of tea. 
They have a number of brunch mains, desserts, cocktails, beef nachos and $10++ truffle fries. 
The ambiance is like a stylish, not that high end bingsu cafe!
Upstairs they have a second outlet, a dessert bar, which I suppose specialises in desserts, coffee and tea.
I think Cafe De Muse should figure out what its specialty is, right now it seems like they have many different food items on their menu.

The pasta was piping hot, waited maybe 15 minutes for it. Came with pumpkin puree and basil (I think) and sun dried tomatoes (vegetarian option I believe). Kind of like baby food! It‚Äôs alright. I was wondering why there was no tomato based pasta on the menu and they informed me that they are gonna be adding that. Right now there‚Äôs squid ink, carbonara, prawn aglio olio and the pumpkin pasta.
There were a number of customers in the cafe, groups of people as well as people working on their computers.
Might try their bingsu next time, they have a number of flavours like Oreo, rice cake (or rice powder), brownie, cheesecake, green tea, melon, strawberry, and more. They also appear to sell their own brand of tea. 
They have a number of brunch mains, desserts, cocktails, beef nachos and $10++ truffle fries. 
The ambiance is like a stylish, not that high end bingsu cafe!
Upstairs they have a second outlet, a dessert bar, which I suppose specialises in desserts, coffee and tea.

This time round, they have introduced ricebowls ranging from the price point of $10.90-$15.90, which to me was pretty affordable as each bowl comes with saut√©ed Thai asparagus and a fried egg. We both shared the Nyonya Salmon ($15.90) and Salted Egg Squid ($14.90), which to my amazement the salmon was under-seasoned and lacking in flavours while the salted egg squid probably fared slightly better. We were told that the Norweigan filleted salmon has been roasted with a traditional nyonya spices but we found no traces of it, except probably for a few specks of chillis. The squid, on the other hand, has been battered and stir-fried in a salted egg sauce but I would probably be better off getting it from a zhi char stall. The additional orders of cheese fries ($6.50) and buttered sweetcorn ($5) did little to save the meal.

1194,hong-seng-eating-house,Hotplate Mixed Grill @ Hock Kee Western,"Fried fish had an interesting batter, that did not become soggy despite being soaked in the sauce for 10minutes, and enhanced the sweetness of the fish fillet.

Served piping hot in a claypot, the fragrant gravy was chock-full of sweetish ""chye por"" that had been simmered with tonnes of chopped garlic. Every food item I'd picked, went very well with it except for the tempura-ed brinjal. Its fried batter coating became sadly soggy but I should have anticipated that I guess. Because I'd liked the smooth ""chee cheong fun"" on my first visit here, I ordered it again. It was as good as before but on hindsight, plain rice would have been a better fit for this preparation style.
Prices aren't cheap though. First they count the number of YTF pieces - I had 7 which cost $6.30 (minimum is 5). Then because I ordered the ""chye por"" sauce, it was $1.50 more. Lastly, my two strips of ""chee cheong fun"" added on another $2, rounding up the total bill to $9.80. Fortunately, the food's tasty, the venue has air-conditioning and the staff is a friendly bunch, so I don't mind.
Good news for Muslims - they have applied for halal certification and are expecting to get approval soon.

With such a great deal of 1-for-1 mains, you have to order their whole steamed fish, which we chose the Seabass ($24.80) that‚Äôs prepared in Cantonese style. There is absolutely no muddy aroma and the meat shined through with the pairing of the light soya sauce. Besides seafood, there are other options in the menu such as the Buttermilk Chicken ($13.80) which was kinda underwhelming and you are better off leaving stomach space for other items. Besides that, a must-order is the Homemade Tofu with Crispy Kailan Floss ($14.90), that‚Äôs served on a sizzling plate. I am not a huge fan of those egg tofu served in zichar stalls and will usually avoid eating them. However, the tofu here has no eggy stench and the inside is almost pudding-like with a crispy exterior. The kalian floss is a good excuse that you are eating your vegetables while the egg mixture surrounding it lends a good texture to the entire dish.

1342,ah-hua-kelong-1,"Thanks to Burpple Beyond, we had such a satisfying meal at Ah Hua Kelong.","If you are not aware, the seafood here are locally farmed and hence, you can be assured of its quality and freshness. With such a great deal of 1-for-1 mains, you have to order their whole steamed fish, which we chose the Seabass ($24.80) that‚Äôs prepared in Cantonese style. There is absolutely no muddy aroma and the meat shined through with the pairing of the light soya sauce. Besides seafood, there are other options in the menu such as the Buttermilk Chicken ($13.80) which was kinda underwhelming and you are better off leaving stomach space for other items. Besides that, a must-order is the Homemade Tofu with Crispy Kailan Floss ($14.90), that‚Äôs served on a sizzling plate. I am not a huge fan of those egg tofu served in zichar stalls and will usually avoid eating them. However, the tofu here has no eggy stench and the inside is almost pudding-like with a crispy exterior. The kalian floss is a good excuse that you are eating your vegetables while the egg mixture surrounding it lends a good texture to the entire dish.

Found ourselves having a light bite in the area, and returned for just the Bingsu because we have had Kaya and Butter Toast by the time we came back. Settled for the Mango Bingsu considering Wan Wan Thai Cafe is pretty much a Thai-themed cafe at heart, but while the shaved milk ice was very well-executed being incredibly smooth and fluffy without melting too easily, the mango cubes were disappointing at best ‚Äî a little raw for our liking with some bits being still hard and crunchy, while the softer cubes felt it was coming short of the sweetness usually associated with Thai mangoes. Otherwise, the entire Bingsu did feel quite decent ‚Äî aptly sweet from the whipped cream, mango ice-cream and mango sauce after a slight drizzle of the condensed milk on the side. That being said, a 45 minute wait for a Bingsu is a little excessive; appreciated how the staff did inform us about the long wait and apologised upon order, though having just one staff prepping everything from Mini Toasts to Bingsu to drinks from their opening to somewhere mid-meal does seem somewhat understaffed given the crowd there on a Sunday afternoon. A decent place for sweet treats if one has the luxury of time to wait, though probably the Mango Bingsu is one item I would not likely to return for.",Xing Wei Chua,@the_xw,ambience,"ground, level, without, clear, signage, indicating, existence, visited","['ground', 'level', 'without', 'clear', 'signage', 'indicating', 'existence', 'visited']","['without', 'clear', 'indicating', 'visited']",0,ambience,ambience

From the pouring of the rice flour and water mixture over a hot steaming plate that eventually forms these thin rice rice rolls over a span of about 2 mins, to sprinkling/lining the fillings (depending on what you choose from char siew/prawn/scallop/abalone) and then lifting the entire sheet up for cutting. It is then placed on a metal surface where oil has already been poured before it's rolled up and cut using a scraper by another person. Finally some sweet soy sauce was poured over and sesame seeds sprinkled over before it's served.
See how transparent it is, such that the fillings are revealed. Intended for it to be a side, but the 3 rice rolls were so filling that it became a main for me. Thought they could have gone easy with the sweet soy sauce though. Even the sambal chili was on the sweeter side. But such a standard for a hawker stall, it's pretty impressive. So smooth, so silky!

The mushroom Japchae($8) we ordered was just meh. It was lacking ingredients like mushrooms (it's a mushroom dish), sesame oil and it had a strong raw carroty taste. We decided it tasted better dropped into our army stew. 
Would be great if they offered free banchan (side dishes) like other Korean places but they don't.
One thing that could use serious improvement though is the customer service. We were blantedly ignored by 3 different waiters and waitresses even though the place wasn't busy. We only wanted to call for additional water and these service people saw us waving, but they all decided turned their heads and face another direction. They were idle at that point. Yeah... ummm real friendly. So when we finally got the female waitress to stop to hear us out 15 minutes later when she scooted past, first thing she did was to slot us a receipt. Which came as a surprise too because nobody told us iced water was chargeable and on a non-refillable basis. Water came 10mins later. What a tale lol.

282,takagi-ramen-blk-498-jurong-west-street-41,I rather eat Instant Ramen,"The first time I chanced upon Takagi Ramen on Grabfood, I was excited as it was during CB period and I was craving for Ramen. It was with such excitement coursing through my veins that I proceeded to order a Karakamen set (with Fried Gyoza). 
However, upon receiving the Ramen, my excitement quickly dissipated to be swiftly replaced with disappointment. 
The noodles were stiff and had a weird aftertaste and the soup had so much of the chilli Oil added that I could only taste the oil and none of the soup which made eating the ramen an unpleasant experience. The ramen egg that came along with it was so bland that I think the Hanjuku Eggs of 7-11 would taste like heaven. All in all, my family members and I came to a conclusion that the best item of this Ramen Set was the fried gyoza. 
Fast forward to yesterday, when my friends and I were looking to have dinner after our exercise session, we happen to come across this outlet at Jurong West and immediately, alarm bells start ringing in my head. Although I was very hesitant to have this, seeing how my friends did not try it before and we were very very hungry, I decided to give this another chance. 
I ordered the Black Tonkotsu Set (with fried gyoza and nope no egg for fearing of what‚Äôs to come). When the noodles arrived, the aromatic smell of the Black Garlic Oil rumbled my stomach juices and I was thinking ‚Äúwow will eating here make a difference, is it redemption time ?‚Äù. However that thought was quickly put to bed upon the first sip of the soup. For all the aromatics of the black garlic oil, the soup was very very lacklustre and it was only until I added almost all of the chilli powder did it have some form of character to it. All in all, my friends and I agreed unanimously that the star of the ramen set was the fried gyoza & the chilli powder.
All in all, I think the $$ we paid for the ramen (avg of $16) is not worth it. Perhaps, to compare this Ramen to other more ‚Äúfamous‚Äù Ramen brands in Singapore is very unfair as it would be akin to comparing a Toyota to a Nissan GT-R. A more suitable comparison to this would be Ajisen Ramen but I vividly recall that the broth of Ajisen Ramen was more flavourful....

The ramen egg that came along with it was so bland that I think the Hanjuku Eggs of 7-11 would taste like heaven. All in all, my family members and I came to a conclusion that the best item of this Ramen Set was the fried gyoza. 
Fast forward to yesterday, when my friends and I were looking to have dinner after our exercise session, we happen to come across this outlet at Jurong West and immediately, alarm bells start ringing in my head. Although I was very hesitant to have this, seeing how my friends did not try it before and we were very very hungry, I decided to give this another chance. 
I ordered the Black Tonkotsu Set (with fried gyoza and nope no egg for fearing of what‚Äôs to come). When the noodles arrived, the aromatic smell of the Black Garlic Oil rumbled my stomach juices and I was thinking ‚Äúwow will eating here make a difference, is it redemption time ?‚Äù. However that thought was quickly put to bed upon the first sip of the soup. For all the aromatics of the black garlic oil, the soup was very very lacklustre and it was only until I added almost all of the chilli powder did it have some form of character to it. All in all, my friends and I agreed unanimously that the star of the ramen set was the fried gyoza & the chilli powder.
All in all, I think the $$ we paid for the ramen (avg of $16) is not worth it. Perhaps, to compare this Ramen to other more ‚Äúfamous‚Äù Ramen brands in Singapore is very unfair as it would be akin to comparing a Toyota to a Nissan GT-R.

497,eleven-strands,Braised Beef Cheeks ($25),"The mushrooms were really the star, cooked to perfection and that umami flavour really lifted and carried this dish. 
While the beef was tender with perfect texture, I felt like it was sorely under seasoned. I tried moping up with sauce with it but it didn't do much for me. The mashed potatoes were good but that's it, nothing spectacular. I was expecting it to be creamier as previous reviews have raved about. I definitely have had better at other cafes at similar prices. 
If you are into subtle flavours, this would be great for you. Otherwise, asking for some salt and pepper would probably do you some good. 
Ambience is great, the interior is lovely. I came at 3pm on a weekday and it was empty and it's a great place to chill and hangout with friends.

The cream based sauce was also not appropriate as it has an element of sweetness in its balance; a brown sauce would have added a more savoriness to balance the overall dish.

At first glance, it's an impressive pile of rice. Its piled higher than in their promo picture and packed pretty compactly. Even after the sauce was drizzled over the rice, it didn't collapse. Points for sturdy construction. 
To call it a fried rice, nah. More like mixed rice. Just cooked Japanese rice mixed with those kind of frozen mixed vegetable bits. Rice lacked any seasoning at all. The accompanying condiments were quite little. If you were to mix everything together, it's alot more rice.

The star of the dish is the salted egg yolk sauce. Creamy, rich. Somehow, you won't get sick of this sauce. It sort of makes up for the weak and rather tasteless rice. We had a refill of the sauce. It's an additional of $2.
