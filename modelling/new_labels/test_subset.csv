One of the items we managed to try was the Beef Bulgogi Dosirak (도시락) Lunch Box ($9.90). Looking similar to lunch boxes that parents would usually pack for their kids, the metal tin box contains steamed rice, a sunny side egg, a side of beef bulgogi, kimchi & seaweed!
How it usually is consumed is to close the tin box, shake up the ingredients to have a good mix & you're ready to eat!
If it feels too messy to eat it that way, you can have it as it is, pilling the ingredients on your spoon before consuming.
Apart from Dosirak, you'd be able to find jjigae, fried chicken, kimbap & ramyeon available too! I'll be sharing more in an upcoming post soon.

How it usually is consumed is to close the tin box, shake up the ingredients to have a good mix & you're ready to eat!
If it feels too messy to eat it that way, you can have it as it is, pilling the ingredients on your spoon before consuming.
Apart from Dosirak, you'd be able to find jjigae, fried chicken, kimbap & ramyeon available too! I'll be sharing more in an upcoming post soon.

.","The iced Sikhye ($2.50) offered a light refreshing sweetness at the beginning of each mouthful and we enjoyed how the rice fragrance would slowly dissipate at the back of our throats when we swallowed it. Also, the residues of cooked rice added an interesting texture to the drink.
.
Also, we got the Budae Jigae Ramyeon ($9.90). The ramyeon came in a pretty big bowl and consist of standard army stew ingredients like sausage, luncheon meat, tofu and fishcakes which were all pretty tasty. However, the crux to this dish was the soup base which we thought could be more savoury and that spiciness could be down a notch as well. Another issue was that the noodles was overcooked and tasted slightly soggy.
.
We also ordered the Chap Chae + Soy Chicken Dosirak ($9.90) that came in a rectangular metal box. This dish was right up our alley. The soya sauce chicken was very tender and savoury while the chap chae provided an added sesame fragrance. It felt like we were eating both rice and noodles at the same time due to the glass noodles in the chap chae. Add a piece of kimchi and a piece of egg to each spoonful of this rice mixture for an extra palatable bite!
.
The final item that we got was the 6 pieces Fried Chicken ($7.90) that came in a mix of wingettes and drumettes. There are two flavours to choose from: spicy and soy, and you are allowed to mix the flavours. The chicken was very tender on the inside and was mildly crispy on the outside as the sauce had seeped into the skin, making it less crunchy but more flavourful. Both of us concurred that the soy chicken tasted better than its spicy counterpart as the spicy sauce was rather overwhelming, drawing our attention away from the meat itself.

However, the crux to this dish was the soup base which we thought could be more savoury and that spiciness could be down a notch as well. Another issue was that the noodles was overcooked and tasted slightly soggy.
.
We also ordered the Chap Chae + Soy Chicken Dosirak ($9.90) that came in a rectangular metal box. This dish was right up our alley. The soya sauce chicken was very tender and savoury while the chap chae provided an added sesame fragrance. It felt like we were eating both rice and noodles at the same time due to the glass noodles in the chap chae. Add a piece of kimchi and a piece of egg to each spoonful of this rice mixture for an extra palatable bite!
.
The final item that we got was the 6 pieces Fried Chicken ($7.90) that came in a mix of wingettes and drumettes. There are two flavours to choose from: spicy and soy, and you are allowed to mix the flavours. The chicken was very tender on the inside and was mildly crispy on the outside as the sauce had seeped into the skin, making it less crunchy but more flavourful. Both of us concurred that the soy chicken tasted better than its spicy counterpart as the spicy sauce was rather overwhelming, drawing our attention away from the meat itself.

•
I read someone commenting that there are just too many clams in their bowl of Prawn Noodles with Clams ($6.50).","So I ordered to try. Indeed there were like 3 very fresh prawns and about 25pcs of clams! Wow such generosity and mind you, these are Japanese Asari Clams and damn sweet! I can only say to those customers who don't like many clams is:
1. Order other options!
2. Ask for lesser clams to prevent wastage! Remember must #worldcleanplate!
3. Don't even comment if you have nothing else to say lah... No one will blame you one trust me.

.
.
Deanna’s kitchen use chicken bones and loads of seafood shells instead of pork bones which results in making the broth sweeter! They serve a generous amount of fresh seafood coupled with juicy prawns! Really love this place and can’t wait to come back for more!!! 😍

Here, suckling pigs are spit-roasted daily behind the shop, and coated in a marinade made from a family recipe.
.
The pork meat is tender and moist, with good smoky sweet savoury salty flavour. The skin is wonderfully crisp, with a herbal note from the marinade (I detect at least garlic, lemongrass, and light soy sauce), and crunches loudly when bit.
.
I understand each suckling pig is spit-roasted over wood charcoal for 4 hours, and regularly basted in its own juices. Fresh and succulent, with a balanced ratio of pork meat to fat.
.
No wonder they draw a queue each night. Some buy kilo's to takeaway!.

I understand each suckling pig is spit-roasted over wood charcoal for 4 hours, and regularly basted in its own juices. Fresh and succulent, with a balanced ratio of pork meat to fat.

Unfortunately, the soup was also disappointing - thought the flavour would be amazing with all the seafood, but it tasted like maggi mee soup. Is that why they serve it without spoons? Because the soup isn't worth drinking?
Heard that Captain K is better - haven't been there but I would now like to try.
Side dishes come before your main dishes do. These were very ordinary..... Not like the amazing Korean restaurant side dishes I am used to.

An surprise finding by the food tour led by @eileenongxt. Opened by two lovely couple at year 2008 but serving up taste which tasted like they had been around for decades. Started without recipe, they did trial and error till their satisfaction. .
|
In their bowl of mixed beef soup (S$4.50), we could find a generous amount of their braised brisket and tripe. By its look, I mistaken that it was a Vietnamese style beef style but the taste was totally different. Good crisp from the onion and bean spout contrast with the tender brisket. My guess is the owners slowly simmered the broth with the brisket and bones for its translucent appearance then seasoned with soy sauce. .
|
Another of my favorite would be their braised Tendons ($6.50 - minimum amount). Easily melted in the mouth texture which only be achieved after hours of braised. The sauce had a strong soy sauce taste which might not be everyone liking. Best with a bowl of white rice. .

In their bowl of mixed beef soup (S$4.50), we could find a generous amount of their braised brisket and tripe. By its look, I mistaken that it was a Vietnamese style beef style but the taste was totally different. Good crisp from the onion and bean spout contrast with the tender brisket. My guess is the owners slowly simmered the broth with the brisket and bones for its translucent appearance then seasoned with soy sauce. .
|
Another of my favorite would be their braised Tendons ($6.50 - minimum amount). Easily melted in the mouth texture which only be achieved after hours of braised. The sauce had a strong soy sauce taste which might not be everyone liking. Best with a bowl of white rice. .

Went for the Slipper Lobster Mayo which was really refreshing with its zesty marination, topped with tobiko bits.
Do note that spaces (4-5 tables) are limited on the weekends, especially with the current safe distancing measures and since it's a relatively new cafe. Will definitely be back!

📍 @nunsaram_cafe is now a one stop cafe where you can get both your savoury favourites such as Gimbap and Tteokbokki, as well as your sweet treats! 😃😃
—
The Special Tteokbokki ($14.90) right at the front features original tteokbokki, 2 fried seaweed rolls, 2 fried dumplings 🥟 and half a normal portion of gimbap. Oh, of course with a dollop of stretchy cheese 🧀 right at the top for you to do your perfect cheese pull 😉! With a single 🌶 sign out of a maximum of two, it’s perfect for those of you who love your spice! For those who don’t (and eat beef 🥩) I’d definitely recommend the Bulgogi Tteokbokki ($9.90)! It’s extremely addictive with each piece of chewy rice cake coated with a viscous layer of bulgogi sauce which is slightly salty and has a sweet aftertaste to it 🤤

With a single 🌶 sign out of a maximum of two, it’s perfect for those of you who love your spice! For those who don’t (and eat beef 🥩) I’d definitely recommend the Bulgogi Tteokbokki ($9.90)! It’s extremely addictive with each piece of chewy rice cake coated with a viscous layer of bulgogi sauce which is slightly salty and has a sweet aftertaste to it 🤤

Shaved ice was sufficiently fine.
Topped with red beans, toasted almonds, peanut powder & rice cakes, its taste wasn't great enough to overpower the thought at the back of everyone's minds that Bing Go Jung's version is bigger AND cheaper.
Oreo Bingsu [$12.90]
Little variety in its one-note flavour profile, which tasted like it was almost tailored for a child's palate.
Chocolate Banana Bingsu [$15.90]
It tasted the best out of the three, only by virtue that I like bananas lol.

Pat Bingsu [$12.90]
Shaved ice was sufficiently fine.
Topped with red beans, toasted almonds, peanut powder & rice cakes, its taste wasn't great enough to overpower the thought at the back of everyone's minds that Bing Go Jung's version is bigger AND cheaper.
Oreo Bingsu [$12.90]
Little variety in its one-note flavour profile, which tasted like it was almost tailored for a child's palate.
Chocolate Banana Bingsu [$15.90]
It tasted the best out of the three, only by virtue that I like bananas lol.
What should I try instead?

1319,one-prawn-noodle,Meet THE One Prawn Noodle You Need In Your Life If You Love Prawns.,"Prawn-lovers, you will feel like you’ve died and gone to heaven when you sip the broth by @oneprawnnoodle. It is probably the most intense in prawny-ness (had to invent a word to do this justice) I have ever come across, and what’s more, it feels shockingly silky in the mouth and not at all greasy.
Owned and run by ex-colleagues (Chef Gwyneth and Chef Kun use to work together at @burntends_sg), One Prawn Noodle sells prawn noodles with different toppings. Prices start at $5 for a “Sliced Pork and Prawn” and goes up to $8 for the “Abalone and Prawn”. What I find interesting is the menu of add-ons they offer which lists the parts of a pig: lean meat, skin, intestines, tail and ribs, as well as novel items such as beancurd skin rolls (it is the same kind as you get at #BeautyInAPot and is brilliant dunked in the broth), prawn balls, abalone, vegetables and a whole egg. Despite this, there’s no denying it is their hypnotically rich-to-the-point-of-opaqueness broth that is the be-all and end-all. So the commonsensical thing to do is to order the soup version, right?

From “Quan Ji”, stall #01-57 at Amoy Street Hawker Centre that specialises in “zichar” dishes, comes the utterly sinful and unbelievably tasty “Wong Po Lou Meen” (literal translation: Yellow Cloth Noodles).
The thin egg noodles and “chye sim” are first blanched then tossed in a criminal amount of pork lard oil and oyster sauce. Over this fragrant heap goes a freshly-cooked prawn omelette that is thick, silky-soft and perfumed with a maddening amount of “wok hei”.

Recommend their deep fried fish! Super duper crispy and the sauce goes really very well with rice!
The venison with ginger & spring onion is also another nice dish, the ginger got rid of the meat smell and the meat is really tender, like!

Tucked away at Blk 47 Tanglin Halt Road, one can differentiate due to the settings, light music, wine glass, Alaskan Crabs which are not normally found at a HDB area. I quickly settled in with my family, 7 adults & 4 kids and started ordering....1) 虾酱鸡 which was not bad and because we were famished after waiting 45 minutes, another serving was ordered. Only to realized from the helper that the chef here cooks by the table ordering so if you ordered again, it would probably take a while😡😡😡 2) 肥牛豆芽 deliciously done...yum 3) 蚝卷 had an unusual taste...oyster and salted egg yolk combination not bad 4) 烩饭 looks too wet for my liking. Mui Fan should be sticky gravy and not like watery porridge 5) 螃蟹米粉 - claims to be top 15 in Singapore, I agreed to give them that as its top 15!!!

The XLBs had very umami soup inside, & the skin is of the thickness & softness that it should be. It doesn't break easily either, so there's little to no soup wastage due to accidents.
The dumplings were filled with lots of meat, which delights me. Very value for money. The same can be said about the skin here too.
I also like how you help yourself to the ginger & vinegar at the stall, because I generally eat a mountain of ginger & less vinegar than the average person. So I can #optimize, here. 
I immediately bought some frozen ones to bring home & steam when I need a quick fix for a meal. They come in bags of 10 each - $6.50 per bag of XLB, $4.50 per bag of dumplings. Pretty competitive pricing for such excellent quality!

The XLBs had very umami soup inside, & the skin is of the thickness & softness that it should be. It doesn't break easily either, so there's little to no soup wastage due to accidents.
The dumplings were filled with lots of meat, which delights me. Very value for money. The same can be said about the skin here too.
I also like how you help yourself to the ginger & vinegar at the stall, because I generally eat a mountain of ginger & less vinegar than the average person. So I can #optimize, here.

Went down on the weekend, thinking that I could use Burpple Beyond (BB) but was told that it’s only available during weekdays. This info should have been stated clearly in the deal’s details (which it wasn’t) so that low SES ppl like me can save my trip down and pick another BB restaurant instead 😐 
Had the Smoked Salmon & Egg Waffle($17.90, pictured), Spicy Carbonara Pasta ($15.90) & Forage Signature Drink ($8.50). The Waffle was unique, well-crafted and good value for money. The portion was pretty huge as well. The pasta was a disappointment as it’s just mediocre. Don’t think that the price is justifiable as I have had better and cheaper Carbonara at 5 Senses Bistro (not a sponsored ad lol). The Drink was only 3/4 full from the mason jar which looks like someone drank a huge mouthful before it was served to us 🤔 But reading from other ppl’s review, i think that is just their serving style, which is quite weird?

Had the Smoked Salmon & Egg Waffle($17.90, pictured), Spicy Carbonara Pasta ($15.90) & Forage Signature Drink ($8.50). The Waffle was unique, well-crafted and good value for money. The portion was pretty huge as well. The pasta was a disappointment as it’s just mediocre.

.","I have been exploring food at One North recently and found this place on Burpple!
.
The food here didn’t disappoint. I had the salad option, which includes one main and 2 sides. I chose the salmon with purple potato and broccoli with a small glass kombucha. I enjoyed the thick slice of salmon and the sweet mashed purple potato! I am not a big fan of the kombucha but no complaints since it came with the set.
.
Overall, it’s a hearty healthy meal and I will definitely be back when I am in need of a detox from all the fried food.

.","I have been exploring food at One North recently and found this place on Burpple!
.
The food here didn’t disappoint. I had the salad option, which includes one main and 2 sides. I chose the salmon with purple potato and broccoli with a small glass kombucha. I enjoyed the thick slice of salmon and the sweet mashed purple potato! I am not a big fan of the kombucha but no complaints since it came with the set.
.
Overall, it’s a hearty healthy meal and I will definitely be back when I am in need of a detox from all the fried food.

My advice: just go for regular-sized ones and order different flavours.

We save this place in a wishlist for some time in @burpple app. This lunch we visit the place at noon (just in time before the crowd 😇).
.
The jazz music with the retro Art Deco & musical instruments really transport us back in time. We felt so relaxed like we were in a kopi place but we are here for their Nasi Padang!! 😜
.
Get 2 vege, 1 meat for each set. First time trying chicken rendang and it's so delicious! Highly addictive tapioca leaves in mild spicy curry goes well with bergedil (potato croquette). Sambal goreng is also pretty good. The gravy pour on top of rice gives a little kick to each set. Somehow we feel that we can eat more though. If they give us more rice, we would definitely order extra Tahu Telur to share! 😅
.
Quite common to some Nasi Padang stalls, there is no bill breakdown. We paid $15.5 for 2 sets (including tea). Such a good & reasonable eat in SG that is definitely worthwhile your visit in Orchard. 🍛

Get 2 vege, 1 meat for each set. First time trying chicken rendang and it's so delicious! Highly addictive tapioca leaves in mild spicy curry goes well with bergedil (potato croquette). Sambal goreng is also pretty good. The gravy pour on top of rice gives a little kick to each set. Somehow we feel that we can eat more though. If they give us more rice, we would definitely order extra Tahu Telur to share! 😅

Quite common to some Nasi Padang stalls, there is no bill breakdown. We paid $15.5 for 2 sets (including tea). Such a good & reasonable eat in SG that is definitely worthwhile your visit in Orchard. 🍛

I tried beef gepuk (meat with red chilli), beef rendang, and always with cassava leaves for my nasi padang. Everything taste nice but not the best actually.
The meat lil bit hard for me.
The ‘bakwan’ (veggie fritters) also looks so big and tempting but it turns out too much flour, but again tastewise it’s not bad.

Hokkien Mee - $4

Their hokkien mee is moist but not that flavourful by itself. However with their chilli is a different story all together. Their chilli paste is sweet sour spicy all at once, giving the Hokkien Mee a boost in flavours. Then there are the standard ingredients such as prawn, squid and pork slices, which are quite acceptable. Just a warning, there’s a lot of garlic bits in the dish, which I enjoyed, while some people may not. Hear say their Fried Kway Teow is quite a popular choice too
