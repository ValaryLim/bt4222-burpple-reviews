2lhaZp7B,How do people take clean #Instafood shots at a hawker centre?,"Since my exercise class cancelled I instead went to pig out with congee, Lo Mai Kai and crystal dumplings (total damage for all food in photo was $15), which probably was overkill for 2pax. Lo Mai Kai was recommended as an unusual offering as it is made in house and the rice didn't seem to be the normal sticky glutinous variety. Crystal dumplings were recommended by the stall but I didn't really like the sourness of the sauce. Next time will just stick to the congee which was so smooth it was criminal (bonus that it was not salty too).

bar-bar-black-sheep-kent-ridge,The weekends is near and the westies has more places to chill as @barbarblacksheepofficial opens its doors at NUS along 50 Kent Ridge Crescent (University Cultural Centre).,"Besides booze and wines, they are popular for their Indian cuisine and thai food! That plate of phad thai ($9) has a spicy kick. I love their garlic naan ($3.50) that comes with the right char to go with butter chicken ($12.50) in red and palak paneer in green. What i find really interesting is their in-house Lavazza Nitro Cold Brew Mint Coffee ($6.90) which comes with a strong smoky aftertaste yet it goes down really smooth too. Don’t really know how to explain it. You can try and let me know (not for faint-hearted). It also has live band music from Tues to Sun. Perfect for suppers since they open till 12midnight, and especially those late night dinners after a long day of work. Now you know.

Risotto Funghi Porcini Tartufo Nero ($26++): Arborio rice with porcini mushrooms & black truffle cream. One of the most amazing risottos I've had to date.

Not sure what pink sauce was supposed to mean; I was expecting a creamy tomato sauce, but the sauce felt just it had the same base as the Bolognese which we also ordered. Nonetheless, the homemade pappardelle was excellent (the sauce clung onto it so well), & they were kind enough to swap the usual bacon out for more italian sausage. Appreciated!

big-small-restaurant,私房菜,"A relatively new Chinese restaurant, which is an award winning restaurant in mainland China 🇨🇳 , offering private home 🏡 cuisine 私房菜 , without the usual seasonings such as MSG, salt and castor sugar.
~
Some of the dishes (pictured above) which we had tonite :
- Sautéed Tender Meat with Black Fungus 葱香梅肉炒秋耳 (S$14.80/ large, S$11.80/ small)
- Braised Tofu in Special Sauce 風味醬燜豆腐 (S$11.80/ large, S$8.80/ small)
- Gold Medal 🥇 Pork Rib with Pineapple 🍍 金牌西菠排骨 (S$28)
- Sweet & Sour Seabass 糖醋金目鱸魚 🐟 (S$32)
- Qiubi Prawn 🦐 丘比虾 (S$22)
- Stewed Pork with Brown Sauce 私房紅燒肉 (S$16)
~
Interestingly orange 🍊 juice, dragon fruit and other assorted fruits were used to make the sauce for Sweet & Sour Seabass, instead of the usual vinegar, which was why some customers may felt that the flavours may be not as strong as expected.
The soya bean milk offered here had an acquired taste especially for the unsweetened version. It's known as Five Flavours of Soy Milk 招牌五味濃縮豆漿 (S$2.80), as it's made of soya bean, red bean, green bean, black bean, and peanut 🥜.
~
This month the restaurant is having a lunch promotion with Gold Medal 🥇 Pork Rib with Pineapple 🍍 Rice 金牌西菠排骨饭 at S$3.80, instead of usual S$7.60.
- Limited to first 50 dine in customers everyday.

big-small-restaurant,私房菜,"A relatively new Chinese restaurant, which is an award winning restaurant in mainland China 🇨🇳 , offering private home 🏡 cuisine 私房菜 , without the usual seasonings such as MSG, salt and castor sugar.
~
Some of the dishes (pictured above) which we had tonite :
- Sautéed Tender Meat with Black Fungus 葱香梅肉炒秋耳 (S$14.80/ large, S$11.80/ small)
- Braised Tofu in Special Sauce 風味醬燜豆腐 (S$11.80/ large, S$8.80/ small)
- Gold Medal 🥇 Pork Rib with Pineapple 🍍 金牌西菠排骨 (S$28)
- Sweet & Sour Seabass 糖醋金目鱸魚 🐟 (S$32)
- Qiubi Prawn 🦐 丘比虾 (S$22)
- Stewed Pork with Brown Sauce 私房紅燒肉 (S$16)
~
Interestingly orange 🍊 juice, dragon fruit and other assorted fruits were used to make the sauce for Sweet & Sour Seabass, instead of the usual vinegar, which was why some customers may felt that the flavours may be not as strong as expected.
The soya bean milk offered here had an acquired taste especially for the unsweetened version. It's known as Five Flavours of Soy Milk 招牌五味濃縮豆漿 (S$2.80), as it's made of soya bean, red bean, green bean, black bean, and peanut 🥜.
~
This month the restaurant is having a lunch promotion with Gold Medal 🥇 Pork Rib with Pineapple 🍍 Rice 金牌西菠排骨饭 at S$3.80, instead of usual S$7.60.
- Limited to first 50 dine in customers everyday.

bread-yard,Matcha x Hazelnut Cruffins ,"I've been wanting to try these since I first heard about it during my trip to Sweden - so glad I found it here!
Matcha cruffin - definitely a must-try! The cruffin was filled generously with Matcha. Loved that it wasn't too sweet, had just the right amount of rich-ness which made it so easy to finish. 
Hazelnut cruffin - a flavour that can't go wrong. Paled in comparison to the Matcha cruffin... till we asked the staff if he could help us reheat it. So glad we did because it was just pure hazlenut goodness oozing out from our buttery pastry, and we thoroughly enjoyed it!
The cruffins were so good we had to buy it back for our family! So we bought the passionfruit and lychee to try + the matcha cruffin because we were really impressed by it!

butterndspice,Thanks to @butterndspice for the invite to try their northern indian cuisine...,".

We ordered the Palak Paneer and Butter Chicken Set... With many of those pre-mixed paste outside is really not easy to find a restaurant that makes their own paste... Souren, the in-charge of the day shared with us, their paste is all home-made... Eg. For their butter chicken paste, they used spices and herbs and fresh tomatoes to blend and cook into puree... Makes the taste much more refreshing as compared to the common ones we had anywhere else... The Paneer is very garlicky... Which really opens the palate and we tried their Masala Chai too... Love it... .
.
What's best is, they even have an all day set-meal going at $10 only, with the main we ordered it comes with Garlic Naan(my fav) and also a bowl of Basmati Rice...

butterndspice,Thanks to @butterndspice for the invite to try their northern indian cuisine...,".
.
We ordered the Palak Paneer and Butter Chicken Set... With many of those pre-mixed paste outside is really not easy to find a restaurant that makes their own paste... Souren, the in-charge of the day shared with us, their paste is all home-made... Eg. For their butter chicken paste, they used spices and herbs and fresh tomatoes to blend and cook into puree... Makes the taste much more refreshing as compared to the common ones we had anywhere else... The Paneer is very garlicky... Which really opens the palate and we tried their Masala Chai too... Love it... .
.
What's best is, they even have an all day set-meal going at $10 only, with the main we ordered it comes with Garlic Naan(my fav) and also a bowl of Basmati Rice...

canteen-bistro,Meatball Omurice with Demi-Glacé Sauce,"Visited the new Canteen Bistro at Singapore Management University, which takes the place of the former premises of now-defunct B3: Burger Beer Bistro, located just a short distance away from Bencoolen MRT Station. Serving up only Omurice during lunch service, the Omurice here comes with various selection of ingredients such as Crispy Chicken, Fish Fillet or Mushroom, as well as a choice of sauce from Cream Sauce, Marinara, and Demi-Glacé. 
The Meatball Omurice is decently portioned for $8, though comes with its own hits and misses — the hits being the omelette itself and the Demi-Glacé sauce; the egg comes flavourful and blankets the bed of flavoured rice perfectly, being slightly runny for a good texture, while the Demi-Glacé sauce comes with an evident hint of meatiness, being a beef sauce that carries also the savoury notes of a typical brown sauce. The rice comes with a slight tang, though that it could be cooked for slightly longer considering that the grains were a tad tough, while the meatballs also felt a bit dry and doughy somewhat; the Omurice also comes with some greens such as cherry tomatoes, cucumber and coleslaw for a refreshing crunch and burst of flavours.

chatuchak-thai-tea,Thai milk tea is one drink that I can never resist whenever I visit Bangkok and I much prefer my beverage with less sugar.,"I was delighted the drinks here at Chatuchak (located at Icon Village) are less sweet - sugar reduced to suit the evolving healthy local taste. Ingredients used are directly sourced from Thailand, ensuring the quality of each cup of tea. Yogurt-based drinks are also available here but my personal favourite is still the original thai milk tea and green milk tea.

chuan-kee-satay,Famous Grilled Pork Satay from Old Airport.,"Chuan Kee Satay began as a family business in the 1970s and specialises in Hainanese-style satay, served with peanut-with-pineapple sauce.
Regulars would tell you to NOT come at peak hours, or the wait can be closer to an hour or beyond.
Also, I observed that there is no queueing or buzzer system, and auntie recognises customers and order sequence by faces or what they wear.
Chuan Kee’s Hainanese-style satays are grilled for a longer duration over a low fire.
Though not the most generous when it comes to amount of meat per stick, Chuan Kee Satay is affordable at $0.60 per stick (minimum order of 10 sticks). They are famous for pork satay, though I found mine surprisingly on the tough side.
The chicken satay was good though, tender and basted in a sticky, golden syrup exuding the aroma of lemongrass and coriander. The sugars in the syrup help create that caramelisation, and eventually, a beautiful charring.

Available every Friday to Sunday, starting 30 September, get your dose of protein under the night sky at Park Hotel Clarke Quay with an array of premium offerings -fresh Cajun-spiced Tiger Prawns, tender Tumeric-laced Arrow Squid, U.S Baby Back Ribs in Spicy Chipotle Sauce and Australian Rack of Lamb spiced with rosemary as well as dijon mustard so you get none of that gamey taste. However, what stood out for me is definitely their signature New Zealand Angus Striploin and Grilled Mackerel Fillet in Banana Leaf (with sambal belacan) that were perfectly executed. Juicy and nicely pink in the middle, the former delivered a great meaty texture while the mackerel seasoned slightly heavier was moist and silky smooth. The assortment of pastries and sweets were also crowd-pleasing so be sure to make a reservation as seating are pretty limited! 
*Buffet starts from 6:30pm to 10:30pm at $57++ per adult and $28.50++ for children between 6 and 12 years old. Inclusive of a glass of draft beer.

However, what stood out for me is definitely their signature New Zealand Angus Striploin and Grilled Mackerel Fillet in Banana Leaf (with sambal belacan) that were perfectly executed. Juicy and nicely pink in the middle, the former delivered a great meaty texture while the mackerel seasoned slightly heavier was moist and silky smooth. The assortment of pastries and sweets were also crowd-pleasing so be sure to make a reservation as seating are pretty limited!

cocobolo,Weekend Barbecue Buffet Dinner By The Pool,"I N V I T E D T A S T I N G
At the risk of sounding like a spoiled brat, I must admit when it comes to barbecues, I like eating the food but hate having to do the barbecuing myself. So imagine my delight to learn that Cocobolo Poolside Bar + Grill at Park Hotel Clarke Quay has a team of chefs who will do all the hard (and hot) work for me. YESSS!! 💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻
This is especially important with the launch of their revamped Weekend Barbecue Buffet Dinner starting this 30th of September, because there’ll be so much to feast on.
When I arrived at tonight’s media tasting, the aroma of freshly-grilled premium meats and seafood in the air was enough to make my mouth water. Naturally, I couldn’t wait to attack the spread. Being a meat-lover, I made a beeline for the New Zealand steaks and U.S. Baby Back Ribs. They didn't disappoint. Expertly barbecued to seal in the juices, the meats were tender and flavourful. For the price, I knew the steak would not fall into the melt-in-the-mouth category but it's a good way to enjoy multiple pieces of meat without burning a hole in my pocket.
Looking equally inviting was the seafood on display, especially those fresh, large Cajun-spiced Tiger Prawns. After spending time over the fire, they turned out to be firm and sweet (which probably explains their immense popularity tonight). The Tumeric-laced Arrow Squid was another delicious surprise. Having been well-marinated, they were fragrant and really soft to the bite. Another winner was the Grilled Mackerel in Banana Leaf. The fish had been seasoned with some mildly spicy ""rempah"", then wrapped with banana leaf in silver foil for barbecuing. This style of preparation meant the fish was steaming hot upon unwrapping, and tasted exceedingly soft and moist.
Also vying for space in my tummy were salads, side dishes, a few hot items and desserts. Don't fall off your chair but shockingly, I was much too full to desserts 😱😱
I guess there's always a next time! 😄

At the risk of sounding like a spoiled brat, I must admit when it comes to barbecues, I like eating the food but hate having to do the barbecuing myself. So imagine my delight to learn that Cocobolo Poolside Bar + Grill at Park Hotel Clarke Quay has a team of chefs who will do all the hard (and hot) work for me. YESSS!! 💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻
This is especially important with the launch of their revamped Weekend Barbecue Buffet Dinner starting this 30th of September, because there’ll be so much to feast on.
When I arrived at tonight’s media tasting, the aroma of freshly-grilled premium meats and seafood in the air was enough to make my mouth water. Naturally, I couldn’t wait to attack the spread. Being a meat-lover, I made a beeline for the New Zealand steaks and U.S. Baby Back Ribs. They didn't disappoint. Expertly barbecued to seal in the juices, the meats were tender and flavourful. For the price, I knew the steak would not fall into the melt-in-the-mouth category but it's a good way to enjoy multiple pieces of meat without burning a hole in my pocket.
Looking equally inviting was the seafood on display, especially those fresh, large Cajun-spiced Tiger Prawns. After spending time over the fire, they turned out to be firm and sweet (which probably explains their immense popularity tonight). The Tumeric-laced Arrow Squid was another delicious surprise. Having been well-marinated, they were fragrant and really soft to the bite. Another winner was the Grilled Mackerel in Banana Leaf. The fish had been seasoned with some mildly spicy ""rempah"", then wrapped with banana leaf in silver foil for barbecuing. This style of preparation meant the fish was steaming hot upon unwrapping, and tasted exceedingly soft and moist.
Also vying for space in my tummy were salads, side dishes, a few hot items and desserts. Don't fall off your chair but shockingly, I was much too full to desserts 😱😱
I guess there's always a next time! 😄

cocobolo,Weekend Barbecue Buffet Dinner By The Pool,"I N V I T E D T A S T I N G
At the risk of sounding like a spoiled brat, I must admit when it comes to barbecues, I like eating the food but hate having to do the barbecuing myself. So imagine my delight to learn that Cocobolo Poolside Bar + Grill at Park Hotel Clarke Quay has a team of chefs who will do all the hard (and hot) work for me. YESSS!! 💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻
This is especially important with the launch of their revamped Weekend Barbecue Buffet Dinner starting this 30th of September, because there’ll be so much to feast on.
When I arrived at tonight’s media tasting, the aroma of freshly-grilled premium meats and seafood in the air was enough to make my mouth water. Naturally, I couldn’t wait to attack the spread. Being a meat-lover, I made a beeline for the New Zealand steaks and U.S. Baby Back Ribs. They didn't disappoint. Expertly barbecued to seal in the juices, the meats were tender and flavourful. For the price, I knew the steak would not fall into the melt-in-the-mouth category but it's a good way to enjoy multiple pieces of meat without burning a hole in my pocket.
Looking equally inviting was the seafood on display, especially those fresh, large Cajun-spiced Tiger Prawns. After spending time over the fire, they turned out to be firm and sweet (which probably explains their immense popularity tonight). The Tumeric-laced Arrow Squid was another delicious surprise. Having been well-marinated, they were fragrant and really soft to the bite. Another winner was the Grilled Mackerel in Banana Leaf. The fish had been seasoned with some mildly spicy ""rempah"", then wrapped with banana leaf in silver foil for barbecuing. This style of preparation meant the fish was steaming hot upon unwrapping, and tasted exceedingly soft and moist.
Also vying for space in my tummy were salads, side dishes, a few hot items and desserts. Don't fall off your chair but shockingly, I was much too full to desserts 😱😱
I guess there's always a next time! 😄

Cocobolo Poolside Bar + Grill at Park Hotel Clarke Quay might just be the best, fuss-free option to satisfy your BBQ cravings.
-
Indulge in a sumptuous BBQ buffet featuring premium meats like Australian Rack of Lamb (pictured above), N.Z. Angus Steak and U.S. Baby Back Ribs, alongside grilled seafood, array of appetizers and sweet treats.
-
My favourites gotta be the lamb rack, baby back ribs, tiger prawns, squid and grilled pineapple! I like how the meats/seafood are grilled a la minute and that you can actually request your meats to be grilled to your preferred level of doneness. And those sexy grill lines on the meats make them look exceptionally inviting. Haha!
-
What's more, dining by the pool means there might be bikini babes/hunks with chiseled abs to look at! Feast for the eyes (and tummy)! hahaha. In case you are wondering, nope, we didn't get to see any eye candy that day. Boo. Then again, who knows you might be lucky?

A spin-off from their usual Singaporean fried street food offerings, CurryTimes strives to be an expert in things Peranakan.","As the name suggests, curry is their specialty, and this dish does not disappoint. This bowl of curry was served to us piping hot and fragrant, with tender chicken and scrumptious potato immersed in the luscious mixture - absolutely delectable, I say. The price, however, is a different matter altogether; I'd recommend patronising this establishment only if you happen to be in the vicinity, for you definitely could get your curry fix at comparable quality, if not better, at your friendly neighbourhood hawker centre or kopitiam.

Rating: 3.5/5
Worth the calories? Probably. Though maybe not for a whopping $14.90!

She has a unique chee cheong fun that is filled with savoury turnips and carrots and then rolled up which is also really lovely .

Kueh / chee cheong fun stall 
Very very very very very good yam cake
Have you ordered yam cakes and left completely disgusted with an a purple coloured “ flour cake” loaded with msg and artificial colouring ?
That’s the reason why I only get my yam cakes from this place.
In a discreet coffee shop at Blk 19 toh Yi drive ( just next to 7-11), there’s a humble stall with a lovely motherly lady owner Who has been selling high quality yam cakes , chee cheong fun , rice dumplings and her home made “Hae bee bian “ ( made with ikan billis ) for the past 21 years.
It is a short walk from Bukit Timah Hawker centre and I am Glad that I able to come visit her stall this morning. She still remembers me as the lady who made the almond paste for her 😊 ( our secret pact 🤣🤣🤣)
The yam cake is so jam filled with yam - you sometimes wonder how she can even cover her costs. It is served at the right temperature - neither too hot or too cold and that speaks a lot about the owner’s knowledge about food . Kuehs like yam cakes when served too hot , disintegrates easily and is sticky and when served too cold , doesn’t bring out the flavour . 
As if the yam cake on its own wasn’t already heavenly enough , she goes the extra mile in serving her home made “ Hae bee hiam” which is uniquely made without Hae bee alongside her yam cake. With an additional touch of sweet sauce ( and not a huge gallon like what most stalls do outside ), this yam cake is really the best yam cake in Singapore 😊 ( alongside the standards of le Tian Tian at Bukit Timah plaza ) - only that this is more affordable .
What’s more , I like the morning vibes of sitting in a coffee shop and the sight of families coming together for breakfast leisurely is just such a joy . 
You should also give her rice dumplings and her Chwee kueh a try because they are all good 😊 but the champion is still the yam cake and as I type this , I am contemplating ordering another huge piece 🤣 after walloping one . The auntie was indeed so sweet by offering me an additional chee kueh as an appreciation of our friendship 😊
You will be pleased to know that within the same coffee shop is also a stall specialising in breakfast bee hoon ( both white and brown ) and breakfast noodles which has a huge following and a stall selling pretty good chicken rice :) 
The coffee shop is comfortable to sit in because it is airy and clean and the best way that I would like to spend each morning ( if only it is was nearer to where I live ) 😊

Kueh / chee cheong fun stall 
Very very very very very good yam cake
Have you ordered yam cakes and left completely disgusted with an a purple coloured “ flour cake” loaded with msg and artificial colouring ?
That’s the reason why I only get my yam cakes from this place.
In a discreet coffee shop at Blk 19 toh Yi drive ( just next to 7-11), there’s a humble stall with a lovely motherly lady owner Who has been selling high quality yam cakes , chee cheong fun , rice dumplings and her home made “Hae bee bian “ ( made with ikan billis ) for the past 21 years.
It is a short walk from Bukit Timah Hawker centre and I am Glad that I able to come visit her stall this morning. She still remembers me as the lady who made the almond paste for her 😊 ( our secret pact 🤣🤣🤣)
The yam cake is so jam filled with yam - you sometimes wonder how she can even cover her costs. It is served at the right temperature - neither too hot or too cold and that speaks a lot about the owner’s knowledge about food . Kuehs like yam cakes when served too hot , disintegrates easily and is sticky and when served too cold , doesn’t bring out the flavour . 
As if the yam cake on its own wasn’t already heavenly enough , she goes the extra mile in serving her home made “ Hae bee hiam” which is uniquely made without Hae bee alongside her yam cake. With an additional touch of sweet sauce ( and not a huge gallon like what most stalls do outside ), this yam cake is really the best yam cake in Singapore 😊 ( alongside the standards of le Tian Tian at Bukit Timah plaza ) - only that this is more affordable .
What’s more , I like the morning vibes of sitting in a coffee shop and the sight of families coming together for breakfast leisurely is just such a joy . 
You should also give her rice dumplings and her Chwee kueh a try because they are all good 😊 but the champion is still the yam cake and as I type this , I am contemplating ordering another huge piece 🤣 after walloping one . The auntie was indeed so sweet by offering me an additional chee kueh as an appreciation of our friendship 😊

In a discreet coffee shop at Blk 19 toh Yi drive ( just next to 7-11), there’s a humble stall with a lovely motherly lady owner Who has been selling high quality yam cakes , chee cheong fun , rice dumplings and her home made “Hae bee bian “ ( made with ikan billis ) for the past 21 years.
It is a short walk from Bukit Timah Hawker centre and I am Glad that I able to come visit her stall this morning. She still remembers me as the lady who made the almond paste for her 😊 ( our secret pact 🤣🤣🤣)
The yam cake is so jam filled with yam - you sometimes wonder how she can even cover her costs. It is served at the right temperature - neither too hot or too cold and that speaks a lot about the owner’s knowledge about food . Kuehs like yam cakes when served too hot , disintegrates easily and is sticky and when served too cold , doesn’t bring out the flavour . 
As if the yam cake on its own wasn’t already heavenly enough , she goes the extra mile in serving her home made “ Hae bee hiam” which is uniquely made without Hae bee alongside her yam cake. With an additional touch of sweet sauce ( and not a huge gallon like what most stalls do outside ), this yam cake is really the best yam cake in Singapore 😊 ( alongside the standards of le Tian Tian at Bukit Timah plaza ) - only that this is more affordable .
What’s more , I like the morning vibes of sitting in a coffee shop and the sight of families coming together for breakfast leisurely is just such a joy . 
You should also give her rice dumplings and her Chwee kueh a try because they are all good 😊 but the champion is still the yam cake and as I type this , I am contemplating ordering another huge piece 🤣 after walloping one . The auntie was indeed so sweet by offering me an additional chee kueh as an appreciation of our friendship 😊
You will be pleased to know that within the same coffee shop is also a stall specialising in breakfast bee hoon ( both white and brown ) and breakfast noodles which has a huge following and a stall selling pretty good chicken rice :) 
The coffee shop is comfortable to sit in because it is airy and clean and the best way that I would like to spend each morning ( if only it is was nearer to where I live ) 😊

It is served at the right temperature - neither too hot or too cold and that speaks a lot about the owner’s knowledge about food . Kuehs like yam cakes when served too hot , disintegrates easily and is sticky and when served too cold , doesn’t bring out the flavour . 
As if the yam cake on its own wasn’t already heavenly enough , she goes the extra mile in serving her home made “ Hae bee hiam” which is uniquely made without Hae bee alongside her yam cake. With an additional touch of sweet sauce ( and not a huge gallon like what most stalls do outside ), this yam cake is really the best yam cake in Singapore 😊 ( alongside the standards of le Tian Tian at Bukit Timah plaza ) - only that this is more affordable .
What’s more , I like the morning vibes of sitting in a coffee shop and the sight of families coming together for breakfast leisurely is just such a joy . 
You should also give her rice dumplings and her Chwee kueh a try because they are all good 😊 but the champion is still the yam cake and as I type this , I am contemplating ordering another huge piece 🤣 after walloping one . The auntie was indeed so sweet by offering me an additional chee kueh as an appreciation of our friendship 😊
You will be pleased to know that within the same coffee shop is also a stall specialising in breakfast bee hoon ( both white and brown ) and breakfast noodles which has a huge following and a stall selling pretty good chicken rice :) 
The coffee shop is comfortable to sit in because it is airy and clean and the best way that I would like to spend each morning ( if only it is was nearer to where I live ) 😊

・
Impressed with @delifrance.sg latest creations cause all 3 flavours tasted awesome😍 Major love for their rendition of bo luo as you can see, it’s THICK (shiok).","Plus, it isn’t as sweet as the normal bo luo which complements well with all the Lava fillings. There’s also a lovely contrast of biscuit crunch and soft texture within a piece. Ate all 3 at one go and the sweetness aren’t overwhelming at all👍🏻
・
The process of eating can be a little messy and tearing them into halves create hurricanes of flakes accompanied by drops of lava filling (wasted lots of tissues cleaning my hands and the table😂). Anyway, with an awesome slab of bo luo and generous fillings, it’s definitely worth the calories and money.

delifrance-singapore-4,"Salted Egg | Hazelnut Praline | Sea Salt Dark Chocolate Bo Luo Croissant [S$7.40]
・
Impressed with @delifrance.sg latest creations cause all 3 flavours tasted awesome😍 Major love for their rendition of bo luo as you can see, it’s THICK (shiok).","Plus, it isn’t as sweet as the normal bo luo which complements well with all the Lava fillings. There’s also a lovely contrast of biscuit crunch and soft texture within a piece. Ate all 3 at one go and the sweetness aren’t overwhelming at all👍🏻
・
The process of eating can be a little messy and tearing them into halves create hurricanes of flakes accompanied by drops of lava filling (wasted lots of tissues cleaning my hands and the table😂). Anyway, with an awesome slab of bo luo and generous fillings, it’s definitely worth the calories and money.

Other available croissant flavours include Blueberry Cream Cheese, Crunchy Peanut and Kaya & Butter. ‣ 1pc/ S$2.80
‣ 3pcs/ S$7.40

After considering asking the server who their pasta supplier is, my mum and I realised upon walking out that their pasta is handmade by one of their chefs! It's truly the most al dente pasta I've ever eaten and it just absorbs all the flavour. If I had to describe happiness to a person, I'd just make them eat this instead. 
Plus! The lunch set is one of the best deals ever. You can choose any dish from 4 categories: starters, pastas, mains and desserts. This means that you could actually get a pasta and a main (a protein like fish/steak) for only $36!

Unfortunately we could only pay with cash since we used the voucher(which was of inconvenience to me). I shared it with my siblings and they prefered the smoked chicken over the other.

Thereafter, you can choose either the Norwegian Salmon or the Beef Rib Eye as your main course, in which the restaurant is fine tuning the dish as when we tried it, it was slightly under-seasoned but nonetheless both the salmon and beef have a nice texture and not overly cooked. Last but not least, you can look forward to sweet treats of either of the Torrijas or Cream Catalana (pictured) and we both felt that they ended strong with the dessert course as both were very good, especially the Cream Catalana, which is similar to a crème brûlée.

For savoury, we ordered No. 7 and 9 and both had really interesting flavours that pushed the boundaries of what a crepe could do.

No. 7: The French pork sausage stole the show by balancing the right amount of saltiness with the neutral flavour of the crepe. However, one could not really taste the “onion confit marinated
in cider, old style mustard cream, comte cheese”, which was a shame. The cream on top honestly just tasted like mayonnaise. 6.5/10
No. 9: Slightly inferior as the filling tasted like rösti with carbonara sauce. The Bayonne ham was nice though. Same thing as No. 7, the description of the dish promised a whole lot more than what was delivered. 6/10
For sweet crepe we ordered No. 19, which was with chestnut cream and mascarpone. The chestnut cream was basically an elevated kaya jam with a nutty aftertaste. The mascarpone was more like a whipped cream than cheese. 5/10, would not recommend.
Very disappointed and doubtful that the crepes contained the ingredients it described (“marinated in cider”, “white wine pickled”?). For three crepes, the bill came up to be slightly more than $60.

No. 7: The French pork sausage stole the show by balancing the right amount of saltiness with the neutral flavour of the crepe. However, one could not really taste the “onion confit marinated
in cider, old style mustard cream, comte cheese”, which was a shame. The cream on top honestly just tasted like mayonnaise. 6.5/10
No. 9: Slightly inferior as the filling tasted like rösti with carbonara sauce. The Bayonne ham was nice though. Same thing as No. 7, the description of the dish promised a whole lot more than what was delivered. 6/10
For sweet crepe we ordered No. 19, which was with chestnut cream and mascarpone. The chestnut cream was basically an elevated kaya jam with a nutty aftertaste. The mascarpone was more like a whipped cream than cheese. 5/10, would not recommend.

Some people eat it for the spicy soup, a handful might like it for the cockles and others like me, eat it for the tau pok (fried beancurd puff)! The tau pok that has been so well cooked in the Laksa soup that it has absorbed all that tasty broth into itself, one that will reward you with a burst of the glorious spicy broth with every bite!

If you are one of those who cannot care less about the cockles and enjoys the tau pok and spicy broth in a Laksa, I think you will like @greendotsg 's Vegetarian Laksa (SGD 5.90).

Though Green Dot's spicy broth does not have dried shrimps and consequently lack a little umami flavor, it still manages to be tasty. Spice level is moderate and for those who wants an extra kick, chopped chillies are available on the side so don't worry.

guo-fu-steamboat,Full Steam Ahead,"All I’m sayin is, y’all had no idea how delighted I was when the hotpot buffets reopened. Sure, there ain’t no more sauce bar thanks to the corona, but you get a waitress coming over with a condiment cart at the press of a button. I ain’t pressed, I actually quite like the tableside service.⠀
⠀
Guo Fu Steamboat has been on my must try list for the longest time, and my gaaawwwddd it’s the perfect first post lockdown hotpot buffet. The lunch buffet is reasonable enough at $25.90++, and you get free flow EVERYTHING for two hours straight. Yes, even the xiao long baos. Of course, some things are far more worthy of your stomach’s real estate than others, and the special pork on the left & the premium beef on the right are undeniably worthy. Just look at the marbling, man. That’s decent quality right there.⠀
⠀
Unfortunately, the soup bases incur an additional charge, and my choice of the (Super) Male Vitality Soup was an extra seven bucks. Still, service is stellar for a hotpot place, and Guo Fu’s individual hotpots are certainly the new meta during this coronavirus chaos. They don’t really heat up that well, but they are ideal for enforcing social segregation so you don’t get the big coof.⠀

Enjoy tasty and affordable Japanese rice and noodles fare at this new and Halal-friendly eatery that is conveniently located near Bencoolen MRT Station.","Featured here is the Gyu-don which comprises a generous serving of savoury-sweet thin slices of US beef, onions and a wobbly onsen egg resting on a bed of pearly-white rice.

Enjoy tasty and affordable Japanese rice and noodles fare at this new and Halal-friendly eatery that is conveniently located near Bencoolen MRT Station.","Featured here is the Gyu-don which comprises a generous serving of savoury-sweet thin slices of US beef, onions and a wobbly onsen egg resting on a bed of pearly-white rice. The sauce that is drizzled over the Gyu-don is the same concoction that is used to simmer the tender beef slices for hours. Thus, the gravy is flavourful and rich with beefy essence.
The meals at Gyūnion are hearty and value for money and this is definitely a place worth checking out, especially if you are attending school or working in the Bencoolen area.

Their Paitan is the hot favourite among us because it is light yet savoury enough. Well, this one-month old restaurant under Sushi Tei offers casual dining at affordable prices. This beef ramen is the most expensive item here, can you believe it? Located at Vivocity Level 2 beside Sushi Tei.

The not-so-good:
- noodles were lumpy and had strong alkaline taste
- gravy was dry and flavor wise pretty bland
