I highly recommend you to add copious amounts of the sauce to your porridge, a match made in heaven.

I'm not too sure if I've tried this before but I do find the sauce quite nostalgic, not too sure how to describe it. It came with Szechuan dried chili, slices of ginger, and cloves of mushy garlic (As a fan of garlic, this was heavenly by the way). I'm not too sure if the skin of the chicken is supposed to be soggy but it's still a decent dish overall.

Had to drink lots of water after that. Seems like a lot of items (eggs, other jap side dishes) in the previous reviews are also not there anymore :(",Athena Khoo,@othanic,food,drink lots ,food,,0

bella-pasta,Delicious But I'm Confused,"PAPPARDELLE BOSCAIOLA ($26++)
Not sure what pink sauce was supposed to mean; I was expecting a creamy tomato sauce, but the sauce felt just it had the same base as the Bolognese which we also ordered. Nonetheless, the homemade pappardelle was excellent (the sauce clung onto it so well), & they were kind enough to swap the usual bacon out for more italian sausage. Appreciated! But still wondering about the sauce.

Nonetheless, the homemade pappardelle was excellent (the sauce clung onto it so well), & they were kind enough to swap the usual bacon out for more italian sausage. Appreciated! But still wondering about the sauce.

The truffle flavour was really good and portion size was a bit bigger than I thought I could finish. It's a tad too oily as it leaves your lips greasy after every bite.

~
Some of the dishes (pictured above) which we had tonite :
- Sautéed Tender Meat with Black Fungus 葱香梅肉炒秋耳 (S$14.80/ large, S$11.80/ small)
- Braised Tofu in Special Sauce 風味醬燜豆腐 (S$11.80/ large, S$8.80/ small)
- Gold Medal 🥇 Pork Rib with Pineapple 🍍 金牌西菠排骨 (S$28)
- Sweet & Sour Seabass 糖醋金目鱸魚 🐟 (S$32)
- Qiubi Prawn 🦐 丘比虾 (S$22)
- Stewed Pork with Brown Sauce 私房紅燒肉 (S$16)
~
Interestingly orange 🍊 juice, dragon fruit and other assorted fruits were used to make the sauce for Sweet & Sour Seabass, instead of the usual vinegar, which was why some customers may felt that the flavours may be not as strong as expected.
The soya bean milk offered here had an acquired taste especially for the unsweetened version. It's known as Five Flavours of Soy Milk 招牌五味濃縮豆漿 (S$2.80), as it's made of soya bean, red bean, green bean, black bean, and peanut 🥜.
~
This month the restaurant is having a lunch promotion with Gold Medal 🥇 Pork Rib with Pineapple 🍍 Rice 金牌西菠排骨饭 at S$3.80, instead of usual S$7.60.

Some of the dishes (pictured above) which we had tonite :
- Sautéed Tender Meat with Black Fungus 葱香梅肉炒秋耳 (S$14.80/ large, S$11.80/ small)
- Braised Tofu in Special Sauce 風味醬燜豆腐 (S$11.80/ large, S$8.80/ small)
- Gold Medal 🥇 Pork Rib with Pineapple 🍍 金牌西菠排骨 (S$28)
- Sweet & Sour Seabass 糖醋金目鱸魚 🐟 (S$32)
- Qiubi Prawn 🦐 丘比虾 (S$22)
- Stewed Pork with Brown Sauce 私房紅燒肉 (S$16)
~
Interestingly orange 🍊 juice, dragon fruit and other assorted fruits were used to make the sauce for Sweet & Sour Seabass, instead of the usual vinegar, which was why some customers may felt that the flavours may be not as strong as expected.
The soya bean milk offered here had an acquired taste especially for the unsweetened version. It's known as Five Flavours of Soy Milk 招牌五味濃縮豆漿 (S$2.80), as it's made of soya bean, red bean, green bean, black bean, and peanut 🥜.
~
This month the restaurant is having a lunch promotion with Gold Medal 🥇 Pork Rib with Pineapple 🍍 Rice 金牌西菠排骨饭 at S$3.80, instead of usual S$7.60.
- Limited to first 50 dine in customers everyday.

botanico,"I am usually not a big fan of raw food but when this Seabass Ceviche ($17) was brought out onto the table, the medley of colours and different elements in the plate makes it very enticing to resist.","This dish is essentially Chef Sujatha’s interpretation of Assam Laksa which comes with cubes of cured seabass, green chili, pomegranate and shaved ginger flower, paired with a tamarind dressed glass noodles which brings an additional zing and lightness into the dish. The cold element will be the shrimp paste ice cream, weird at first thought but surprisingly able to create a harmony between all the ingredients. This for me was by far one of my favorites for the night.

bread-yard,Matcha x Hazelnut Cruffins ,"I've been wanting to try these since I first heard about it during my trip to Sweden - so glad I found it here!
Matcha cruffin - definitely a must-try! The cruffin was filled generously with Matcha. Loved that it wasn't too sweet, had just the right amount of rich-ness which made it so easy to finish. 
Hazelnut cruffin - a flavour that can't go wrong. Paled in comparison to the Matcha cruffin... till we asked the staff if he could help us reheat it. So glad we did because it was just pure hazlenut goodness oozing out from our buttery pastry, and we thoroughly enjoyed it!
The cruffins were so good we had to buy it back for our family! So we bought the passionfruit and lychee to try + the matcha cruffin because we were really impressed by it!
(Not in picture) We had a cup of blue pea yuan yang as well - tasted more like white coffee but overall would rate it a pretty good drink to go with our dessert. 
Damage was $5 per cruffin but would say it's well worth the price. Will definitely be back to try their other pastries.

We ordered the Palak Paneer and Butter Chicken Set... With many of those pre-mixed paste outside is really not easy to find a restaurant that makes their own paste... Souren, the in-charge of the day shared with us, their paste is all home-made... Eg. For their butter chicken paste, they used spices and herbs and fresh tomatoes to blend and cook into puree... Makes the taste much more refreshing as compared to the common ones we had anywhere else... The Paneer is very garlicky... Which really opens the palate and we tried their Masala Chai too... Love it... .
.
What's best is, they even have an all day set-meal going at $10 only, with the main we ordered it comes with Garlic Naan(my fav) and also a bowl of Basmati Rice...
.

Is rare we finish everything on the table... For this yes, so meaning is really so good that we didn't leave any behind 😋

Souren, the in-charge of the day shared with us, their paste is all home-made... Eg. For their butter chicken paste, they used spices and herbs and fresh tomatoes to blend and cook into puree... Makes the taste much more refreshing as compared to the common ones we had anywhere else... The Paneer is very garlicky... Which really opens the palate and we tried their Masala Chai too... Love it... .
.
What's best is, they even have an all day set-meal going at $10 only, with the main we ordered it comes with Garlic Naan(my fav) and also a bowl of Basmati Rice...
.
.
Is rare we finish everything on the table... For this yes, so meaning is really so good that we didn't leave any behind 😋

Don't miss out this authentic place for good northern indian food ;)

You have a choice of Demi glaze sauce or marinara or cream sauce and I preferred the demi glaze sauce because it’s lighter and pairs better with the egg and rice. The chicken (well battered and juicy) and egg (creamy and smooth) were actually the best part of the dish for me. Defo worth trying once.

canteen-bistro,Meatball Omurice with Demi-Glacé Sauce,"Visited the new Canteen Bistro at Singapore Management University, which takes the place of the former premises of now-defunct B3: Burger Beer Bistro, located just a short distance away from Bencoolen MRT Station. Serving up only Omurice during lunch service, the Omurice here comes with various selection of ingredients such as Crispy Chicken, Fish Fillet or Mushroom, as well as a choice of sauce from Cream Sauce, Marinara, and Demi-Glacé. 
The Meatball Omurice is decently portioned for $8, though comes with its own hits and misses — the hits being the omelette itself and the Demi-Glacé sauce; the egg comes flavourful and blankets the bed of flavoured rice perfectly, being slightly runny for a good texture, while the Demi-Glacé sauce comes with an evident hint of meatiness, being a beef sauce that carries also the savoury notes of a typical brown sauce. The rice comes with a slight tang, though that it could be cooked for slightly longer considering that the grains were a tad tough, while the meatballs also felt a bit dry and doughy somewhat; the Omurice also comes with some greens such as cherry tomatoes, cucumber and coleslaw for a refreshing crunch and burst of flavours. Not too bad for those who are not too picky with what they are eating, and an interesting option to have around on campus overall.",Xing Wei Chua,@the_xw,food,of the ,,,0

Somehow the Crispy Chocolate Cake was not as satisfying this time round.

chatuchak-thai-tea,Thai milk tea is one drink that I can never resist whenever I visit Bangkok and I much prefer my beverage with less sugar.,"I was delighted the drinks here at Chatuchak (located at Icon Village) are less sweet - sugar reduced to suit the evolving healthy local taste. Ingredients used are directly sourced from Thailand, ensuring the quality of each cup of tea. Yogurt-based drinks are also available here but my personal favourite is still the original thai milk tea and green milk tea.

chuan-kee-satay,Famous Grilled Pork Satay from Old Airport.,"Chuan Kee Satay began as a family business in the 1970s and specialises in Hainanese-style satay, served with peanut-with-pineapple sauce.
Regulars would tell you to NOT come at peak hours, or the wait can be closer to an hour or beyond.
Also, I observed that there is no queueing or buzzer system, and auntie recognises customers and order sequence by faces or what they wear.
Chuan Kee’s Hainanese-style satays are grilled for a longer duration over a low fire.
Though not the most generous when it comes to amount of meat per stick, Chuan Kee Satay is affordable at $0.60 per stick (minimum order of 10 sticks). They are famous for pork satay, though I found mine surprisingly on the tough side.
The chicken satay was good though, tender and basted in a sticky, golden syrup exuding the aroma of lemongrass and coriander. The sugars in the syrup help create that caramelisation, and eventually, a beautiful charring.

Their cable-ski facilities will be open in the future if you're looking for activities to enjoy with friends and family.
Meanwhile, this isn't your usual fluffy waffle ($8), the texture is a little like a thick pancake but still delicious. As I'm not a huge fan of chocolate sauce, I'd ask them to hold back on it next time and just enjoy it with the fruits and Ice cream. 😊

Today I got for myself a Cheesy Beef Nachos Pizza (S$22.00), because I seldom hear of such a combination in our local restaurants (either that or I hardly explore pizza parlours). The waiting time for the pizza is a bit long, but I reckon that they made the pizza from scratch, so the wait was relatively bearable.
And this piece of food came from the kitchen. It first wow-ed me with the crispiness of the pizza dough, partly also because it was very thin. So, every bite of it had that crackling sound effect. Pretty tasty, I must say, and perhaps also a good item to pair with their beer.

cocobolo,Weekend Barbecue Buffet Dinner By The Pool,"I N V I T E D T A S T I N G
At the risk of sounding like a spoiled brat, I must admit when it comes to barbecues, I like eating the food but hate having to do the barbecuing myself. So imagine my delight to learn that Cocobolo Poolside Bar + Grill at Park Hotel Clarke Quay has a team of chefs who will do all the hard (and hot) work for me. YESSS!! 💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻
This is especially important with the launch of their revamped Weekend Barbecue Buffet Dinner starting this 30th of September, because there’ll be so much to feast on.
When I arrived at tonight’s media tasting, the aroma of freshly-grilled premium meats and seafood in the air was enough to make my mouth water. Naturally, I couldn’t wait to attack the spread. Being a meat-lover, I made a beeline for the New Zealand steaks and U.S. Baby Back Ribs. They didn't disappoint. Expertly barbecued to seal in the juices, the meats were tender and flavourful. For the price, I knew the steak would not fall into the melt-in-the-mouth category but it's a good way to enjoy multiple pieces of meat without burning a hole in my pocket.
Looking equally inviting was the seafood on display, especially those fresh, large Cajun-spiced Tiger Prawns. After spending time over the fire, they turned out to be firm and sweet (which probably explains their immense popularity tonight). The Tumeric-laced Arrow Squid was another delicious surprise. Having been well-marinated, they were fragrant and really soft to the bite. Another winner was the Grilled Mackerel in Banana Leaf. The fish had been seasoned with some mildly spicy ""rempah"", then wrapped with banana leaf in silver foil for barbecuing. This style of preparation meant the fish was steaming hot upon unwrapping, and tasted exceedingly soft and moist.
Also vying for space in my tummy were salads, side dishes, a few hot items and desserts. Don't fall off your chair but shockingly, I was much too full to desserts 😱😱
I guess there's always a next time! 😄

When I arrived at tonight’s media tasting, the aroma of freshly-grilled premium meats and seafood in the air was enough to make my mouth water. Naturally, I couldn’t wait to attack the spread. Being a meat-lover, I made a beeline for the New Zealand steaks and U.S. Baby Back Ribs. They didn't disappoint. Expertly barbecued to seal in the juices, the meats were tender and flavourful. For the price, I knew the steak would not fall into the melt-in-the-mouth category but it's a good way to enjoy multiple pieces of meat without burning a hole in my pocket.
Looking equally inviting was the seafood on display, especially those fresh, large Cajun-spiced Tiger Prawns. After spending time over the fire, they turned out to be firm and sweet (which probably explains their immense popularity tonight). The Tumeric-laced Arrow Squid was another delicious surprise. Having been well-marinated, they were fragrant and really soft to the bite. Another winner was the Grilled Mackerel in Banana Leaf. The fish had been seasoned with some mildly spicy ""rempah"", then wrapped with banana leaf in silver foil for barbecuing. This style of preparation meant the fish was steaming hot upon unwrapping, and tasted exceedingly soft and moist.
Also vying for space in my tummy were salads, side dishes, a few hot items and desserts. Don't fall off your chair but shockingly, I was much too full to desserts 😱😱
I guess there's always a next time! 😄

When I arrived at tonight’s media tasting, the aroma of freshly-grilled premium meats and seafood in the air was enough to make my mouth water. Naturally, I couldn’t wait to attack the spread. Being a meat-lover, I made a beeline for the New Zealand steaks and U.S. Baby Back Ribs. They didn't disappoint. Expertly barbecued to seal in the juices, the meats were tender and flavourful. For the price, I knew the steak would not fall into the melt-in-the-mouth category but it's a good way to enjoy multiple pieces of meat without burning a hole in my pocket.
Looking equally inviting was the seafood on display, especially those fresh, large Cajun-spiced Tiger Prawns. After spending time over the fire, they turned out to be firm and sweet (which probably explains their immense popularity tonight). The Tumeric-laced Arrow Squid was another delicious surprise. Having been well-marinated, they were fragrant and really soft to the bite. Another winner was the Grilled Mackerel in Banana Leaf. The fish had been seasoned with some mildly spicy ""rempah"", then wrapped with banana leaf in silver foil for barbecuing. This style of preparation meant the fish was steaming hot upon unwrapping, and tasted exceedingly soft and moist.
Also vying for space in my tummy were salads, side dishes, a few hot items and desserts. Don't fall off your chair but shockingly, I was much too full to desserts 😱😱
I guess there's always a next time! 😄

Cocobolo Poolside Bar + Grill at Park Hotel Clarke Quay might just be the best, fuss-free option to satisfy your BBQ cravings.
-
Indulge in a sumptuous BBQ buffet featuring premium meats like Australian Rack of Lamb (pictured above), N.Z. Angus Steak and U.S. Baby Back Ribs, alongside grilled seafood, array of appetizers and sweet treats.
-
My favourites gotta be the lamb rack, baby back ribs, tiger prawns, squid and grilled pineapple! I like how the meats/seafood are grilled a la minute and that you can actually request your meats to be grilled to your preferred level of doneness. And those sexy grill lines on the meats make them look exceptionally inviting. Haha!
-
What's more, dining by the pool means there might be bikini babes/hunks with chiseled abs to look at! Feast for the eyes (and tummy)! hahaha. In case you are wondering, nope, we didn't get to see any eye candy that day. Boo. Then again, who knows you might be lucky?

Not so crispy on the outside, fluffy in the inside. I must admit that yes, it is kinda ""jelak"", so I recommend to share it with 2-3 people. Some couples beside me shared this, but still did not finish eating it. (I could finish it by myself. #yay #aintsharing #superbigtummy HAHAHA)

This bowl of curry was served to us piping hot and fragrant, with tender chicken and scrumptious potato immersed in the luscious mixture - absolutely delectable, I say.

In a pretty vibrant coffee shop known to its residents in toh yi drive is a breakfast stall ( that’s next to the chicken rice stall ) that has been my to- go place for a what I call the best yam cake ever 🤗
I love cooking and I know how much work and ingredients is required to make a good yam cake and that’s why I am telling you that you need to go experience this yourself .... it is sooooooo good. It is extremely good . I assure you - it will be worth all the travelling .
The yam cake is so full of authentic yam ( some mashed within and some left unmasked for you to savour ) . Paired with a homemade ikan billis chilli sambal type chilli that is purely homemade - you can’t ask for anything more . 
She has a unique chee cheong fun that is filled with savoury turnips and carrots and then rolled up which is also really lovely . 
This morning she was so Glad that I came by because she wanted to share her homemade black sesame powder which she liberally sprinkled on my yam cake and chee cheong fun and I actually liked the combination you know 👧🏻👧🏻👧🏻 ...

The homemade yam cake is the best - generous use of yam , non greasy and a good accompanying homemade ikan billis chilli that doesn’t use belacan given the stall owner’s choice of preparing healthier food for her customers. This is the best yam cake I have ever tasted - it doesn’t require all of that waxed sausage or mushroom - just lots of yammy goodness .

Kueh / chee cheong fun stall 
Very very very very very good yam cake
Have you ordered yam cakes and left completely disgusted with an a purple coloured “ flour cake” loaded with msg and artificial colouring ?
That’s the reason why I only get my yam cakes from this place.
In a discreet coffee shop at Blk 19 toh Yi drive ( just next to 7-11), there’s a humble stall with a lovely motherly lady owner Who has been selling high quality yam cakes , chee cheong fun , rice dumplings and her home made “Hae bee bian “ ( made with ikan billis ) for the past 21 years.
It is a short walk from Bukit Timah Hawker centre and I am Glad that I able to come visit her stall this morning. She still remembers me as the lady who made the almond paste for her 😊 ( our secret pact 🤣🤣🤣)
The yam cake is so jam filled with yam - you sometimes wonder how she can even cover her costs. It is served at the right temperature - neither too hot or too cold and that speaks a lot about the owner’s knowledge about food . Kuehs like yam cakes when served too hot , disintegrates easily and is sticky and when served too cold , doesn’t bring out the flavour . 
As if the yam cake on its own wasn’t already heavenly enough , she goes the extra mile in serving her home made “ Hae bee hiam” which is uniquely made without Hae bee alongside her yam cake. With an additional touch of sweet sauce ( and not a huge gallon like what most stalls do outside ), this yam cake is really the best yam cake in Singapore 😊 ( alongside the standards of le Tian Tian at Bukit Timah plaza ) - only that this is more affordable .
What’s more , I like the morning vibes of sitting in a coffee shop and the sight of families coming together for breakfast leisurely is just such a joy . 
You should also give her rice dumplings and her Chwee kueh a try because they are all good 😊 but the champion is still the yam cake and as I type this , I am contemplating ordering another huge piece 🤣 after walloping one . The auntie was indeed so sweet by offering me an additional chee kueh as an appreciation of our friendship 😊
You will be pleased to know that within the same coffee shop is also a stall specialising in breakfast bee hoon ( both white and brown ) and breakfast noodles which has a huge following and a stall selling pretty good chicken rice :) 
The coffee shop is comfortable to sit in because it is airy and clean and the best way that I would like to spend each morning ( if only it is was nearer to where I live ) 😊

Kuehs like yam cakes when served too hot , disintegrates easily and is sticky and when served too cold , doesn’t bring out the flavour . 
As if the yam cake on its own wasn’t already heavenly enough , she goes the extra mile in serving her home made “ Hae bee hiam” which is uniquely made without Hae bee alongside her yam cake. With an additional touch of sweet sauce ( and not a huge gallon like what most stalls do outside ), this yam cake is really the best yam cake in Singapore 😊 ( alongside the standards of le Tian Tian at Bukit Timah plaza ) - only that this is more affordable .
What’s more , I like the morning vibes of sitting in a coffee shop and the sight of families coming together for breakfast leisurely is just such a joy . 
You should also give her rice dumplings and her Chwee kueh a try because they are all good 😊 but the champion is still the yam cake and as I type this , I am contemplating ordering another huge piece 🤣 after walloping one . The auntie was indeed so sweet by offering me an additional chee kueh as an appreciation of our friendship 😊
You will be pleased to know that within the same coffee shop is also a stall specialising in breakfast bee hoon ( both white and brown ) and breakfast noodles which has a huge following and a stall selling pretty good chicken rice :) 
The coffee shop is comfortable to sit in because it is airy and clean and the best way that I would like to spend each morning ( if only it is was nearer to where I live ) 😊

Have you ordered yam cakes and left completely disgusted with an a purple coloured “ flour cake” loaded with msg and artificial colouring ?
That’s the reason why I only get my yam cakes from this place.
In a discreet coffee shop at Blk 19 toh Yi drive ( just next to 7-11), there’s a humble stall with a lovely motherly lady owner Who has been selling high quality yam cakes , chee cheong fun , rice dumplings and her home made “Hae bee bian “ ( made with ikan billis ) for the past 21 years.
It is a short walk from Bukit Timah Hawker centre and I am Glad that I able to come visit her stall this morning. She still remembers me as the lady who made the almond paste for her 😊 ( our secret pact 🤣🤣🤣)

delicious-eating-house,Traditional Handmade Yam Cake,"Blk 19 Toh Yi Drive
Coffee Shop ( next to 7 eleven )
Kueh / chee cheong fun stall 
Very very very very very good yam cake
Have you ordered yam cakes and left completely disgusted with an a purple coloured “ flour cake” loaded with msg and artificial colouring ?
That’s the reason why I only get my yam cakes from this place.
In a discreet coffee shop at Blk 19 toh Yi drive ( just next to 7-11), there’s a humble stall with a lovely motherly lady owner Who has been selling high quality yam cakes , chee cheong fun , rice dumplings and her home made “Hae bee bian “ ( made with ikan billis ) for the past 21 years.
It is a short walk from Bukit Timah Hawker centre and I am Glad that I able to come visit her stall this morning. She still remembers me as the lady who made the almond paste for her 😊 ( our secret pact 🤣🤣🤣)
The yam cake is so jam filled with yam - you sometimes wonder how she can even cover her costs. It is served at the right temperature - neither too hot or too cold and that speaks a lot about the owner’s knowledge about food . Kuehs like yam cakes when served too hot , disintegrates easily and is sticky and when served too cold , doesn’t bring out the flavour . 
As if the yam cake on its own wasn’t already heavenly enough , she goes the extra mile in serving her home made “ Hae bee hiam” which is uniquely made without Hae bee alongside her yam cake. With an additional touch of sweet sauce ( and not a huge gallon like what most stalls do outside ), this yam cake is really the best yam cake in Singapore 😊 ( alongside the standards of le Tian Tian at Bukit Timah plaza ) - only that this is more affordable .
What’s more , I like the morning vibes of sitting in a coffee shop and the sight of families coming together for breakfast leisurely is just such a joy . 
You should also give her rice dumplings and her Chwee kueh a try because they are all good 😊 but the champion is still the yam cake and as I type this , I am contemplating ordering another huge piece 🤣 after walloping one . The auntie was indeed so sweet by offering me an additional chee kueh as an appreciation of our friendship 😊
You will be pleased to know that within the same coffee shop is also a stall specialising in breakfast bee hoon ( both white and brown ) and breakfast noodles which has a huge following and a stall selling pretty good chicken rice :) 
The coffee shop is comfortable to sit in because it is airy and clean and the best way that I would like to spend each morning ( if only it is was nearer to where I live ) 😊

Whenever I order salted egg dishes, I'm prepared to be disappointed.","I continue to do so tho in my search for the elusive dish. Imagine my surprise when this plate came. It wasn't just a yellowish syrup that tastes faintly salty. There was actual salted egg and lumps of it can still be seen on the plate. The pork chop was crispy and tender. This, is the real deal.

The process of eating can be a little messy and tearing them into halves create hurricanes of flakes accompanied by drops of lava filling (wasted lots of tissues cleaning my hands and the table😂).

dover-road-kai-kee-wanton-noodle-at-ale,After School Wanton Mee,"It may not be famous, but it occupies a special place in my heart because I literally grew up eating it. Being just across the road from my primary and secondary school, Fairfield Methodist, my friends and I would often eat there after the dismissal bell rang. Having limited pocket money, a plate of $2 wanton mee was the best thing to us. To this day, I still eat it regularly and love everything about it — it carries a special handmade feel, nothing like the factory-made noodles and char siew or wanton you get elsewhere. Because we were still kids who couldn't take chilli so well, the aunty would substitute with tomato ketchup, or you could also order ""see yao yao"" (which I think means ""want soy sauce"") for something more plain that still hits the perfect level of tastiness.

elteatrotapas,"SG Restaurant Week is back and for this Autumn 2020 edition, the event will last from 2 Oct to 18 Oct.","One of the participating restaurants, El Teatro Tapas will be serving a 3-course dinner menu, priced affordably at $38++ per adult. For the starter, main course and dessert, diners will have two options of each to choose from, with the starter being the Crispy Potatoes or Cuttlefish, both great choices and I would recommend the former as the crispy potatoes are topped with mud crab meat with dollops of spicy lime aioli by the side.
Thereafter, you can choose either the Norwegian Salmon or the Beef Rib Eye as your main course, in which the restaurant is fine tuning the dish as when we tried it, it was slightly under-seasoned but nonetheless both the salmon and beef have a nice texture and not overly cooked. Last but not least, you can look forward to sweet treats of either of the Torrijas or Cream Catalana (pictured) and we both felt that they ended strong with the dessert course as both were very good, especially the Cream Catalana, which is similar to a crème brûlée. The milky texture with the tanginess from the passion fruit and fresh berries balanced the flavours well, giving it a refreshing end to the meal.

french-fold,Not Amazing Yet Overpriced,"This place has a great ambience due to its location and interior design! For savoury, we ordered No. 7 and 9 and both had really interesting flavours that pushed the boundaries of what a crepe could do. I liked how buckwheat crepe provide a crispy texture to the fillings it contains.
No. 7: The French pork sausage stole the show by balancing the right amount of saltiness with the neutral flavour of the crepe. However, one could not really taste the “onion confit marinated
in cider, old style mustard cream, comte cheese”, which was a shame. The cream on top honestly just tasted like mayonnaise. 6.5/10
No. 9: Slightly inferior as the filling tasted like rösti with carbonara sauce. The Bayonne ham was nice though. Same thing as No. 7, the description of the dish promised a whole lot more than what was delivered. 6/10
For sweet crepe we ordered No. 19, which was with chestnut cream and mascarpone. The chestnut cream was basically an elevated kaya jam with a nutty aftertaste. The mascarpone was more like a whipped cream than cheese. 5/10, would not recommend.
Very disappointed and doubtful that the crepes contained the ingredients it described (“marinated in cider”, “white wine pickled”?). For three crepes, the bill came up to be slightly more than $60. My main complaint would be that the prices are very steep and honestly, overpriced for food that sounds nicer than it tastes. Great place for one who wants to try French crepes but unlikely to come back again. You’re better off trying their sister restaurant Merci Marcel (which is average at best so that’s saying something).",Jia Yi,@jiayi492,food,ordered no ,,,0

gastromania-da-paolo-1,"The Cottage Pie was quite a wrong choice, given that the waiting time for the reheating was long and the puff pastry atop was served burnt — hard, bitter and to the point a little nauseating (in combination with the tomato sauce at the base of the foil pan).","The restaurant informed that they had spoken to their headquarters about this issue before, but for now, no more Cottage Pie from @dapaolosg Gastronomia for me.

I ordered the beer batterd fish and chips ($15.90) with fries, salad and their homemade tartar sauce. The fish was very crispy but is quite crumbly when I cut it up. Could not really taste the beer batter but the homemade tartar sauce made up for it. Not of a bad dish but would love to try other dishes on their menu.
