.","The iced Sikhye ($2.50) offered a light refreshing sweetness at the beginning of each mouthful and we enjoyed how the rice fragrance would slowly dissipate at the back of our throats when we swallowed it. Also, the residues of cooked rice added an interesting texture to the drink.
.
Also, we got the Budae Jigae Ramyeon ($9.90). The ramyeon came in a pretty big bowl and consist of standard army stew ingredients like sausage, luncheon meat, tofu and fishcakes which were all pretty tasty. However, the crux to this dish was the soup base which we thought could be more savoury and that spiciness could be down a notch as well. Another issue was that the noodles was overcooked and tasted slightly soggy.
.
We also ordered the Chap Chae + Soy Chicken Dosirak ($9.90) that came in a rectangular metal box. This dish was right up our alley. The soya sauce chicken was very tender and savoury while the chap chae provided an added sesame fragrance. It felt like we were eating both rice and noodles at the same time due to the glass noodles in the chap chae. Add a piece of kimchi and a piece of egg to each spoonful of this rice mixture for an extra palatable bite!
.
The final item that we got was the 6 pieces Fried Chicken ($7.90) that came in a mix of wingettes and drumettes. There are two flavours to choose from: spicy and soy, and you are allowed to mix the flavours. The chicken was very tender on the inside and was mildly crispy on the outside as the sauce had seeped into the skin, making it less crunchy but more flavourful. Both of us concurred that the soy chicken tasted better than its spicy counterpart as the spicy sauce was rather overwhelming, drawing our attention away from the meat itself.

.","The iced Sikhye ($2.50) offered a light refreshing sweetness at the beginning of each mouthful and we enjoyed how the rice fragrance would slowly dissipate at the back of our throats when we swallowed it. Also, the residues of cooked rice added an interesting texture to the drink.
.
Also, we got the Budae Jigae Ramyeon ($9.90). The ramyeon came in a pretty big bowl and consist of standard army stew ingredients like sausage, luncheon meat, tofu and fishcakes which were all pretty tasty. However, the crux to this dish was the soup base which we thought could be more savoury and that spiciness could be down a notch as well. Another issue was that the noodles was overcooked and tasted slightly soggy.
.
We also ordered the Chap Chae + Soy Chicken Dosirak ($9.90) that came in a rectangular metal box. This dish was right up our alley. The soya sauce chicken was very tender and savoury while the chap chae provided an added sesame fragrance. It felt like we were eating both rice and noodles at the same time due to the glass noodles in the chap chae. Add a piece of kimchi and a piece of egg to each spoonful of this rice mixture for an extra palatable bite!
.
The final item that we got was the 6 pieces Fried Chicken ($7.90) that came in a mix of wingettes and drumettes. There are two flavours to choose from: spicy and soy, and you are allowed to mix the flavours. The chicken was very tender on the inside and was mildly crispy on the outside as the sauce had seeped into the skin, making it less crunchy but more flavourful. Both of us concurred that the soy chicken tasted better than its spicy counterpart as the spicy sauce was rather overwhelming, drawing our attention away from the meat itself.

.","The iced Sikhye ($2.50) offered a light refreshing sweetness at the beginning of each mouthful and we enjoyed how the rice fragrance would slowly dissipate at the back of our throats when we swallowed it. Also, the residues of cooked rice added an interesting texture to the drink.
.
Also, we got the Budae Jigae Ramyeon ($9.90). The ramyeon came in a pretty big bowl and consist of standard army stew ingredients like sausage, luncheon meat, tofu and fishcakes which were all pretty tasty. However, the crux to this dish was the soup base which we thought could be more savoury and that spiciness could be down a notch as well. Another issue was that the noodles was overcooked and tasted slightly soggy.
.
We also ordered the Chap Chae + Soy Chicken Dosirak ($9.90) that came in a rectangular metal box. This dish was right up our alley. The soya sauce chicken was very tender and savoury while the chap chae provided an added sesame fragrance. It felt like we were eating both rice and noodles at the same time due to the glass noodles in the chap chae. Add a piece of kimchi and a piece of egg to each spoonful of this rice mixture for an extra palatable bite!
.
The final item that we got was the 6 pieces Fried Chicken ($7.90) that came in a mix of wingettes and drumettes. There are two flavours to choose from: spicy and soy, and you are allowed to mix the flavours. The chicken was very tender on the inside and was mildly crispy on the outside as the sauce had seeped into the skin, making it less crunchy but more flavourful. Both of us concurred that the soy chicken tasted better than its spicy counterpart as the spicy sauce was rather overwhelming, drawing our attention away from the meat itself.

Here, suckling pigs are spit-roasted daily behind the shop, and coated in a marinade made from a family recipe.
.
The pork meat is tender and moist, with good smoky sweet savoury salty flavour. The skin is wonderfully crisp, with a herbal note from the marinade (I detect at least garlic, lemongrass, and light soy sauce), and crunches loudly when bit.
.
I understand each suckling pig is spit-roasted over wood charcoal for 4 hours, and regularly basted in its own juices. Fresh and succulent, with a balanced ratio of pork meat to fat.
.
No wonder they draw a queue each night. Some buy kilo's to takeaway!.

An surprise finding by the food tour led by @eileenongxt. Opened by two lovely couple at year 2008 but serving up taste which tasted like they had been around for decades. Started without recipe, they did trial and error till their satisfaction. .
|
In their bowl of mixed beef soup (S$4.50), we could find a generous amount of their braised brisket and tripe. By its look, I mistaken that it was a Vietnamese style beef style but the taste was totally different. Good crisp from the onion and bean spout contrast with the tender brisket. My guess is the owners slowly simmered the broth with the brisket and bones for its translucent appearance then seasoned with soy sauce. .
|
Another of my favorite would be their braised Tendons ($6.50 - minimum amount). Easily melted in the mouth texture which only be achieved after hours of braised. The sauce had a strong soy sauce taste which might not be everyone liking. Best with a bowl of white rice. .

In their bowl of mixed beef soup (S$4.50), we could find a generous amount of their braised brisket and tripe. By its look, I mistaken that it was a Vietnamese style beef style but the taste was totally different. Good crisp from the onion and bean spout contrast with the tender brisket. My guess is the owners slowly simmered the broth with the brisket and bones for its translucent appearance then seasoned with soy sauce. .
|
Another of my favorite would be their braised Tendons ($6.50 - minimum amount). Easily melted in the mouth texture which only be achieved after hours of braised. The sauce had a strong soy sauce taste which might not be everyone liking. Best with a bowl of white rice. .

kizuna-1,Mini Croissant for Two - Egg Mayo & Slipper Lobster Mayo ($7.80++),"New cafe at Potong Pasir | Love the space and ambience at this new little hideout. Menu was pretty interesting as well with several unique items, one of which was their selection of croissants. Went for the Slipper Lobster Mayo which was really refreshing with its zesty marination, topped with tobiko bits.
Do note that spaces (4-5 tables) are limited on the weekends, especially with the current safe distancing measures and since it's a relatively new cafe. Will definitely be back!

‚Äî
üìç @nunsaram_cafe is now a one stop cafe where you can get both your savoury favourites such as Gimbap and Tteokbokki, as well as your sweet treats! üòÉüòÉ
‚Äî
The Special Tteokbokki ($14.90) right at the front features original tteokbokki, 2 fried seaweed rolls, 2 fried dumplings ü•ü and half a normal portion of gimbap. Oh, of course with a dollop of stretchy cheese üßÄ right at the top for you to do your perfect cheese pull üòâ! With a single üå∂ sign out of a maximum of two, it‚Äôs perfect for those of you who love your spice! For those who don‚Äôt (and eat beef ü•©) I‚Äôd definitely recommend the Bulgogi Tteokbokki ($9.90)!

Pat Bingsu [$12.90]
Shaved ice was sufficiently fine.
Topped with red beans, toasted almonds, peanut powder & rice cakes, its taste wasn't great enough to overpower the thought at the back of everyone's minds that Bing Go Jung's version is bigger AND cheaper.
Oreo Bingsu [$12.90]
Little variety in its one-note flavour profile, which tasted like it was almost tailored for a child's palate.
Chocolate Banana Bingsu [$15.90]
It tasted the best out of the three, only by virtue that I like bananas lol.
What should I try instead?

Pat Bingsu [$12.90]
Shaved ice was sufficiently fine.
Topped with red beans, toasted almonds, peanut powder & rice cakes, its taste wasn't great enough to overpower the thought at the back of everyone's minds that Bing Go Jung's version is bigger AND cheaper.
Oreo Bingsu [$12.90]
Little variety in its one-note flavour profile, which tasted like it was almost tailored for a child's palate.
Chocolate Banana Bingsu [$15.90]
It tasted the best out of the three, only by virtue that I like bananas lol.

Stuffing was neutral in taste. There weren‚Äôt any flavour related to chicken rice other than the heat from the chili. And also the rice filling tasted more like glutinous rice rather than chicken rice

Owned and run by ex-colleagues (Chef Gwyneth and Chef Kun use to work together at @burntends_sg), One Prawn Noodle sells prawn noodles with different toppings. Prices start at $5 for a ‚ÄúSliced Pork and Prawn‚Äù and goes up to $8 for the ‚ÄúAbalone and Prawn‚Äù. What I find interesting is the menu of add-ons they offer which lists the parts of a pig: lean meat, skin, intestines, tail and ribs, as well as novel items such as beancurd skin rolls (it is the same kind as you get at #BeautyInAPot and is brilliant dunked in the broth), prawn balls, abalone, vegetables and a whole egg. Despite this, there‚Äôs no denying it is their hypnotically rich-to-the-point-of-opaqueness broth that is the be-all and end-all. So the commonsensical thing to do is to order the soup version, right? However, what if I told you that the dry-style is the one I think you should get? You see, this pair of young hawkers make their own sambal chilli too and it is astonishingly tasty.

one-prawn-noodle,Meet THE One Prawn Noodle You Need In Your Life If You Love Prawns.,"Prawn-lovers, you will feel like you‚Äôve died and gone to heaven when you sip the broth by @oneprawnnoodle. It is probably the most intense in prawny-ness (had to invent a word to do this justice) I have ever come across, and what‚Äôs more, it feels shockingly silky in the mouth and not at all greasy.
Owned and run by ex-colleagues (Chef Gwyneth and Chef Kun use to work together at @burntends_sg), One Prawn Noodle sells prawn noodles with different toppings. Prices start at $5 for a ‚ÄúSliced Pork and Prawn‚Äù and goes up to $8 for the ‚ÄúAbalone and Prawn‚Äù. What I find interesting is the menu of add-ons they offer which lists the parts of a pig: lean meat, skin, intestines, tail and ribs, as well as novel items such as beancurd skin rolls (it is the same kind as you get at #BeautyInAPot and is brilliant dunked in the broth), prawn balls, abalone, vegetables and a whole egg. Despite this, there‚Äôs no denying it is their hypnotically rich-to-the-point-of-opaqueness broth that is the be-all and end-all. So the commonsensical thing to do is to order the soup version, right? However, what if I told you that the dry-style is the one I think you should get? You see, this pair of young hawkers make their own sambal chilli too and it is astonishingly tasty. When noodles are tossed in that savoury spiciness, the strands become aromatic and mouthwateringly shiok. To pair, you get a big packet of the magical prawn broth. See? Their dry version really lets you enjoy the best of both worlds üòÑ.

From ‚ÄúQuan Ji‚Äù, stall #01-57 at Amoy Street Hawker Centre that specialises in ‚Äúzichar‚Äù dishes, comes the utterly sinful and unbelievably tasty ‚ÄúWong Po Lou Meen‚Äù (literal translation: Yellow Cloth Noodles).
The thin egg noodles and ‚Äúchye sim‚Äù are first blanched then tossed in a criminal amount of pork lard oil and oyster sauce. Over this fragrant heap goes a freshly-cooked prawn omelette that is thick, silky-soft and perfumed with a maddening amount of ‚Äúwok hei‚Äù.
There is only one portion size for this dish and it costs $20 but it is big enough to be shared among 3 to 4 people. I can‚Äôt wait to return for this soon - it is just too delicious.

The thin egg noodles and ‚Äúchye sim‚Äù are first blanched then tossed in a criminal amount of pork lard oil and oyster sauce. Over this fragrant heap goes a freshly-cooked prawn omelette that is thick, silky-soft and perfumed with a maddening amount of ‚Äúwok hei‚Äù.
There is only one portion size for this dish and it costs $20 but it is big enough to be shared among 3 to 4 people. I can‚Äôt wait to return for this soon - it is just too delicious.

Was very satisfied with these steamed freshly on the spot. Had to wait 5 mins for these to be ready, but it was worth it.
I lunched here during an off-peak hour, so there was only 1 person in front of me in the queue. Normally, during peak hour there is a long line at this stall!
The XLBs had very umami soup inside, & the skin is of the thickness & softness that it should be. It doesn't break easily either, so there's little to no soup wastage due to accidents.
The dumplings were filled with lots of meat, which delights me. Very value for money. The same can be said about the skin here too.
I also like how you help yourself to the ginger & vinegar at the stall, because I generally eat a mountain of ginger & less vinegar than the average person. So I can #optimize, here. 
I immediately bought some frozen ones to bring home & steam when I need a quick fix for a meal. They come in bags of 10 each - $6.50 per bag of XLB, $4.50 per bag of dumplings. Pretty competitive pricing for such excellent quality!

I lunched here during an off-peak hour, so there was only 1 person in front of me in the queue. Normally, during peak hour there is a long line at this stall!
The XLBs had very umami soup inside, & the skin is of the thickness & softness that it should be. It doesn't break easily either, so there's little to no soup wastage due to accidents.
The dumplings were filled with lots of meat, which delights me. Very value for money. The same can be said about the skin here too.
I also like how you help yourself to the ginger & vinegar at the stall, because I generally eat a mountain of ginger & less vinegar than the average person. So I can #optimize, here.

Had the Smoked Salmon & Egg Waffle($17.90, pictured), Spicy Carbonara Pasta ($15.90) & Forage Signature Drink ($8.50). The Waffle was unique, well-crafted and good value for money.

The food here didn‚Äôt disappoint. I had the salad option, which includes one main and 2 sides. I chose the salmon with purple potato and broccoli with a small glass kombucha. I enjoyed the thick slice of salmon and the sweet mashed purple potato! I am not a big fan of the kombucha but no complaints since it came with the set.

Overall, it‚Äôs a hearty healthy meal and I will definitely be back when I am in need of a detox from all the fried food.

tiger-street-lab,Snow Pear Fire Crackle Yusheng ($38.80 for 4 pax) Not your ordinary Yusheng.,"@tigerbeersg, collaborated with @dashijiabigprawnmee to create a special yusheng, which contains Tiger-infused Popping Candies and Shredded Snow Pear that give a ‚Äúfire-crackling‚Äù effect and a refreshing crunch.
Besides that, diners can also enjoy great local flavours with dishes such as
‚Ä¢ üíï Salt Pepper Crispy Shrimps with Curry Leaves. ($14.80).
‚Ä¢ üíïWok-fried King Prawn White Bee Hoon. ($18.80).
‚Ä¢ üíïTiger-Infused Crispy Baby Sotong. ($15.80).
‚Ä¢ üíïPickled Garlic Fried Barramundi Fillet. ($18.80).
My fav dish is the salt pepper crispy shrimps with curry leaves. Pair it with Shiok ale (seasonal brew from Tiger Beer, a tropical medley of passionfruit and pineapples). It‚Äôs so shiok, I couldn‚Äôt stop!
Tiger Street Lab will be operating as per normal on the eve of CNY and all 15 days of Chinese New Year.

tiong-bahru-lee-hong-kee-cantonese-roasted,One of the several Cantonese roasts in Tiong Bahru Market but is this supposedly the more famous one?,"It falls short of expectations as the char siew was a major letdown for me, the meat was slightly tough and it has a slight porky odour. Maybe it‚Äôs just a one-off thing and the pigs were having an off day. The roasted pork on the other hand fared much better for its fat to meat ratio and nicely charred skin.

tomyum-mama,"Claypot Tomyum MAMA‚Äî$12.90
Spicy level 3 and Sour level 2, this claypot has definitely level up our favourite thai tomyum MAMA noodles.","To justify the price, this comes with crab claw meat, prawn, clam, squid, minced pork and the mandatory egg. So good that we ordered a second round. Not enough for 2pax to share la! ü§£
.
Another must-try is their Grilled Moo Ping ($5.90/3pcs). Grilled minced pork that has fats in it to give that sweet patty the omph juicy bites. Pretty reasonable priced side dishes ranging from $3.90-$5.90 generally. Not forgetting thai milktea and greentea ($2.90 each). Try the Jumbo-sized milktea ($12.90) if you have the stomach space to. My advice: just go for regular-sized ones and order different flavours.

The jazz music with the retro Art Deco & musical instruments really transport us back in time. We felt so relaxed like we were in a kopi place but we are here for their Nasi Padang!! üòú
.
Get 2 vege, 1 meat for each set. First time trying chicken rendang and it's so delicious! Highly addictive tapioca leaves in mild spicy curry goes well with bergedil (potato croquette). Sambal goreng is also pretty good. The gravy pour on top of rice gives a little kick to each set. Somehow we feel that we can eat more though. If they give us more rice, we would definitely order extra Tahu Telur to share! üòÖ
.
Quite common to some Nasi Padang stalls, there is no bill breakdown. We paid $15.5 for 2 sets (including tea). Such a good & reasonable eat in SG that is definitely worthwhile your visit in Orchard. üçõ

The jazz music with the retro Art Deco & musical instruments really transport us back in time. We felt so relaxed like we were in a kopi place but we are here for their Nasi Padang!! üòú

Get 2 vege, 1 meat for each set. First time trying chicken rendang and it's so delicious! Highly addictive tapioca leaves in mild spicy curry goes well with bergedil (potato croquette). Sambal goreng is also pretty good. The gravy pour on top of rice gives a little kick to each set. Somehow we feel that we can eat more though.

Hokkien Mee - $4

Their hokkien mee is moist but not that flavourful by itself. However with their chilli is a different story all together. Their chilli paste is sweet sour spicy all at once, giving the Hokkien Mee a boost in flavours. Then there are the standard ingredients such as prawn, squid and pork slices, which are quite acceptable. Just a warning, there‚Äôs a lot of garlic bits in the dish, which I enjoyed, while some people may not. Hear say their Fried Kway Teow is quite a popular choice too

This is righteously fiery. Chunks of fresh tender flaky garoupa fish, bouncy squid, and deshelled prawns, are served in an angry red curry.
.
Rich and thick, this has a bright spicy savoury sweet flavour, with a lingering burn that continues long after the meal.
