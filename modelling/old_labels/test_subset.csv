Katong Laksa ($5.50); The Laksa here is really good, and it definitely live up to its name. The Laksa soup was flavourful, the prawns and cockles were fresh, and they have cut the noodles into smaller pieces which you only require a spoon to scoop and eat.

The Pappardelle was really good. Pasta was a little softer than Al dente, the way I like it. And it was flavourful with a good amount of mushroom. However I felt like I couldn't taste the beef so I'm not sure if they minced it such that I couldn't really get the meat texture.
The spaghetti had a good kick to it from the chilli crab. It was also creamy yet not too overwhelmingly so. It was my favourite dish from here.

al-borgo,Great Pasta,"So we got the Pappardelle alla boscaiola ($25) and Spaghetti e polpa Di granchio ($28).
The Pappardelle was really good. Pasta was a little softer than Al dente, the way I like it. And it was flavourful with a good amount of mushroom. However I felt like I couldn't taste the beef so I'm not sure if they minced it such that I couldn't really get the meat texture.
The spaghetti had a good kick to it from the chilli crab. It was also creamy yet not too overwhelmingly so. It was my favourite dish from here.

How it usually is consumed is to close the tin box, shake up the ingredients to have a good mix & you're ready to eat!
If it feels too messy to eat it that way, you can have it as it is, pilling the ingredients on your spoon before consuming.

.","The iced Sikhye ($2.50) offered a light refreshing sweetness at the beginning of each mouthful and we enjoyed how the rice fragrance would slowly dissipate at the back of our throats when we swallowed it. Also, the residues of cooked rice added an interesting texture to the drink.
.
Also, we got the Budae Jigae Ramyeon ($9.90). The ramyeon came in a pretty big bowl and consist of standard army stew ingredients like sausage, luncheon meat, tofu and fishcakes which were all pretty tasty. However, the crux to this dish was the soup base which we thought could be more savoury and that spiciness could be down a notch as well. Another issue was that the noodles was overcooked and tasted slightly soggy.
.
We also ordered the Chap Chae + Soy Chicken Dosirak ($9.90) that came in a rectangular metal box. This dish was right up our alley. The soya sauce chicken was very tender and savoury while the chap chae provided an added sesame fragrance. It felt like we were eating both rice and noodles at the same time due to the glass noodles in the chap chae. Add a piece of kimchi and a piece of egg to each spoonful of this rice mixture for an extra palatable bite!
.
The final item that we got was the 6 pieces Fried Chicken ($7.90) that came in a mix of wingettes and drumettes. There are two flavours to choose from: spicy and soy, and you are allowed to mix the flavours. The chicken was very tender on the inside and was mildly crispy on the outside as the sauce had seeped into the skin, making it less crunchy but more flavourful. Both of us concurred that the soy chicken tasted better than its spicy counterpart as the spicy sauce was rather overwhelming, drawing our attention away from the meat itself.

.","The iced Sikhye ($2.50) offered a light refreshing sweetness at the beginning of each mouthful and we enjoyed how the rice fragrance would slowly dissipate at the back of our throats when we swallowed it. Also, the residues of cooked rice added an interesting texture to the drink.
.
Also, we got the Budae Jigae Ramyeon ($9.90). The ramyeon came in a pretty big bowl and consist of standard army stew ingredients like sausage, luncheon meat, tofu and fishcakes which were all pretty tasty. However, the crux to this dish was the soup base which we thought could be more savoury and that spiciness could be down a notch as well. Another issue was that the noodles was overcooked and tasted slightly soggy.
.
We also ordered the Chap Chae + Soy Chicken Dosirak ($9.90) that came in a rectangular metal box. This dish was right up our alley. The soya sauce chicken was very tender and savoury while the chap chae provided an added sesame fragrance. It felt like we were eating both rice and noodles at the same time due to the glass noodles in the chap chae. Add a piece of kimchi and a piece of egg to each spoonful of this rice mixture for an extra palatable bite!
.
The final item that we got was the 6 pieces Fried Chicken ($7.90) that came in a mix of wingettes and drumettes. There are two flavours to choose from: spicy and soy, and you are allowed to mix the flavours. The chicken was very tender on the inside and was mildly crispy on the outside as the sauce had seeped into the skin, making it less crunchy but more flavourful. Both of us concurred that the soy chicken tasted better than its spicy counterpart as the spicy sauce was rather overwhelming, drawing our attention away from the meat itself.

.","The iced Sikhye ($2.50) offered a light refreshing sweetness at the beginning of each mouthful and we enjoyed how the rice fragrance would slowly dissipate at the back of our throats when we swallowed it. Also, the residues of cooked rice added an interesting texture to the drink.
.
Also, we got the Budae Jigae Ramyeon ($9.90). The ramyeon came in a pretty big bowl and consist of standard army stew ingredients like sausage, luncheon meat, tofu and fishcakes which were all pretty tasty. However, the crux to this dish was the soup base which we thought could be more savoury and that spiciness could be down a notch as well. Another issue was that the noodles was overcooked and tasted slightly soggy.
.
We also ordered the Chap Chae + Soy Chicken Dosirak ($9.90) that came in a rectangular metal box. This dish was right up our alley. The soya sauce chicken was very tender and savoury while the chap chae provided an added sesame fragrance. It felt like we were eating both rice and noodles at the same time due to the glass noodles in the chap chae. Add a piece of kimchi and a piece of egg to each spoonful of this rice mixture for an extra palatable bite!
.
The final item that we got was the 6 pieces Fried Chicken ($7.90) that came in a mix of wingettes and drumettes. There are two flavours to choose from: spicy and soy, and you are allowed to mix the flavours. The chicken was very tender on the inside and was mildly crispy on the outside as the sauce had seeped into the skin, making it less crunchy but more flavourful. Both of us concurred that the soy chicken tasted better than its spicy counterpart as the spicy sauce was rather overwhelming, drawing our attention away from the meat itself.

Here, suckling pigs are spit-roasted daily behind the shop, and coated in a marinade made from a family recipe.
.
The pork meat is tender and moist, with good smoky sweet savoury salty flavour. The skin is wonderfully crisp, with a herbal note from the marinade (I detect at least garlic, lemongrass, and light soy sauce), and crunches loudly when bit.
.
I understand each suckling pig is spit-roasted over wood charcoal for 4 hours, and regularly basted in its own juices. Fresh and succulent, with a balanced ratio of pork meat to fat.
.
No wonder they draw a queue each night. Some buy kilo's to takeaway!.

I understand each suckling pig is spit-roasted over wood charcoal for 4 hours, and regularly basted in its own juices. Fresh and succulent, with a balanced ratio of pork meat to fat.
.
No wonder they draw a queue each night. Some buy kilo's to takeaway!.

We ordered the lechón sisig and the roasted lechón.
The sisig is some kind of finely chopped lechón with an egg on top. Even though this dish did not taste bad, the meat was loaded with tiny bones, which made this dish quite disappointing and unpleasant to eat.

Typical thick cut succulent & chewy meat with a load of fats & crispy crackling skin.
Dip to the lechon sauce to get the full exposure on whats it's like.
To be honest, I really not sure what I eating after dipping. Can feel the sweetness from the sauce but pair it with lechon, no idea.😅 So I have it without the sauce.
First few pieces were sinfully pleasant, but as when you had your subsequent piece, it gets more and more jelak.🤢(Maybe is the fats)
Haha... But I don't mind just eating the skin.🤣

fong-seng-nasi-lemak,"Mention Fong Seng Nasi Lemak and memories of (perpetually hungry) undergrad days come to mind 😂 After so many years, I had Fong Seng again and I thought the rice (which was quite a lot) didn't taste as ""lemak""-ish as before 😔 but that was many many years ago, so memory may be playing tricks 😛 Anyway what I like about Fong Seng is the wide variety of side dishes you could add.","Here I had the sunny side up (Altho I prefer omelette with nasi lemak!), fish cake, fish tempura and fried chicken wing. The chicken wing is a runaway winner. Super love the crispy skin yet juicy flesh. The sambal tasted a little burnt which was kinda disappointing. But when you're a hungry, hangry, hippo and nothing else seems to be open, this is a pretty good choice. .

four-seasons-cendol,Four Seasons Cendol is commonly recognized by many to serve the best cendol in Singapore.,"Other than an outlet at Toa Payoh Lor 8, I just discovered a branch at Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 Food Centre.
Keep your expectations high when you visit this place for a rich and creamy bowl of sugary delight.
Every bowl is prepared on order and swiftly put together within a minute so you don’t have to wait too long. It is exceptionally tasty and the presentation is also Instagram worthy (shoot your photos fast in this hot weather though). I got myself a bowl of Cendol for $2.20. The bowls already have attap seeds and red beans, filled up with thick green jelly and ice shavings in a perfect dome of deliciousness.

Unfortunately, the soup was also disappointing - thought the flavour would be amazing with all the seafood, but it tasted like maggi mee soup. Is that why they serve it without spoons? Because the soup isn't worth drinking?

The sauces provided isn't a lot though but the rosti is really good. As you can see from the pictures, the exterior is crispy but not overly charred and the potatoes are quite soft inside.

An surprise finding by the food tour led by @eileenongxt. Opened by two lovely couple at year 2008 but serving up taste which tasted like they had been around for decades. Started without recipe, they did trial and error till their satisfaction. .
|
In their bowl of mixed beef soup (S$4.50), we could find a generous amount of their braised brisket and tripe. By its look, I mistaken that it was a Vietnamese style beef style but the taste was totally different. Good crisp from the onion and bean spout contrast with the tender brisket. My guess is the owners slowly simmered the broth with the brisket and bones for its translucent appearance then seasoned with soy sauce. .
|
Another of my favorite would be their braised Tendons ($6.50 - minimum amount). Easily melted in the mouth texture which only be achieved after hours of braised. The sauce had a strong soy sauce taste which might not be everyone liking. Best with a bowl of white rice. .

Enjoying a taste of Hong Kong’s nostalgia food. Hong Kong Cart noodle is a staple and commonly found almost every corner in HK but not in Singapore.😞😞
.
.
Imagine the piping hot bowl of cart noodles with more ingredients than I bargained for. Full of flavour and super tender big intestines is my favourite. Always order 2 portion of this.🍲🍲🍲
.
.
Swiss chicken wings 🐥, marinated egg 🥚, curry fish balls, white radish 🥕 and beef brisket. The beauty of cart noodle is adding as many sides as you desire with your noodle in tasty and addictive broth.😲😲

If you 💖 cart noodle as me, where did you go?

nunsaram-korean-dessert-cafe-1,Special Tteokbokki ($14.90),"Fans of Korean Cuisine 🇰🇷 now has even more reason to rejoice! 🎈

📍 @nunsaram_cafe is now a one stop cafe where you can get both your savoury favourites such as Gimbap and Tteokbokki, as well as your sweet treats! 😃😃
—
The Special Tteokbokki ($14.90) right at the front features original tteokbokki, 2 fried seaweed rolls, 2 fried dumplings 🥟 and half a normal portion of gimbap. Oh, of course with a dollop of stretchy cheese 🧀 right at the top for you to do your perfect cheese pull 😉! With a single 🌶 sign out of a maximum of two, it’s perfect for those of you who love your spice! For those who don’t (and eat beef 🥩) I’d definitely recommend the Bulgogi Tteokbokki ($9.90)! It’s extremely addictive with each piece of chewy rice cake coated with a viscous layer of bulgogi sauce which is slightly salty and has a sweet aftertaste to it 🤤

Topped with red beans, toasted almonds, peanut powder & rice cakes, its taste wasn't great enough to overpower the thought at the back of everyone's minds that Bing Go Jung's version is bigger AND cheaper.

Little variety in its one-note flavour profile, which tasted like it was almost tailored for a child's palate.
Chocolate Banana Bingsu [$15.90]

Pat Bingsu [$12.90]
Shaved ice was sufficiently fine.
Topped with red beans, toasted almonds, peanut powder & rice cakes, its taste wasn't great enough to overpower the thought at the back of everyone's minds that Bing Go Jung's version is bigger AND cheaper.
Oreo Bingsu [$12.90]
Little variety in its one-note flavour profile, which tasted like it was almost tailored for a child's palate.
Chocolate Banana Bingsu [$15.90]
It tasted the best out of the three, only by virtue that I like bananas lol.
What should I try instead?

one-prawn-noodle,Meet THE One Prawn Noodle You Need In Your Life If You Love Prawns.,"Prawn-lovers, you will feel like you’ve died and gone to heaven when you sip the broth by @oneprawnnoodle. It is probably the most intense in prawny-ness (had to invent a word to do this justice) I have ever come across, and what’s more, it feels shockingly silky in the mouth and not at all greasy.
Owned and run by ex-colleagues (Chef Gwyneth and Chef Kun use to work together at @burntends_sg), One Prawn Noodle sells prawn noodles with different toppings. Prices start at $5 for a “Sliced Pork and Prawn” and goes up to $8 for the “Abalone and Prawn”. What I find interesting is the menu of add-ons they offer which lists the parts of a pig: lean meat, skin, intestines, tail and ribs, as well as novel items such as beancurd skin rolls (it is the same kind as you get at #BeautyInAPot and is brilliant dunked in the broth), prawn balls, abalone, vegetables and a whole egg. Despite this, there’s no denying it is their hypnotically rich-to-the-point-of-opaqueness broth that is the be-all and end-all. So the commonsensical thing to do is to order the soup version, right? However, what if I told you that the dry-style is the one I think you should get? You see, this pair of young hawkers make their own sambal chilli too and it is astonishingly tasty. When noodles are tossed in that savoury spiciness, the strands become aromatic and mouthwateringly shiok. To pair, you get a big packet of the magical prawn broth. See? Their dry version really lets you enjoy the best of both worlds 😄.
The stall is open 7 days a week (yes, Gwyneth and Kun are extremely industrious), so do support them and give their food a try. To order, please WhatsApp:

Despite this, there’s no denying it is their hypnotically rich-to-the-point-of-opaqueness broth that is the be-all and end-all. So the commonsensical thing to do is to order the soup version, right? However, what if I told you that the dry-style is the one I think you should get? You see, this pair of young hawkers make their own sambal chilli too and it is astonishingly tasty. When noodles are tossed in that savoury spiciness, the strands become aromatic and mouthwateringly shiok. To pair, you get a big packet of the magical prawn broth. See? Their dry version really lets you enjoy the best of both worlds 😄.

one-prawn-noodle,Meet THE One Prawn Noodle You Need In Your Life If You Love Prawns.,"Prawn-lovers, you will feel like you’ve died and gone to heaven when you sip the broth by @oneprawnnoodle.

quan-ji-amoy-street-food-market,Best. Thing. I. Ate. Today.,"M E D I A T O U R
From “Quan Ji”, stall #01-57 at Amoy Street Hawker Centre that specialises in “zichar” dishes, comes the utterly sinful and unbelievably tasty “Wong Po Lou Meen” (literal translation: Yellow Cloth Noodles).
The thin egg noodles and “chye sim” are first blanched then tossed in a criminal amount of pork lard oil and oyster sauce. Over this fragrant heap goes a freshly-cooked prawn omelette that is thick, silky-soft and perfumed with a maddening amount of “wok hei”.
There is only one portion size for this dish and it costs $20 but it is big enough to be shared among 3 to 4 people. I can’t wait to return for this soon - it is just too delicious.

I lunched here during an off-peak hour, so there was only 1 person in front of me in the queue. Normally, during peak hour there is a long line at this stall!
The XLBs had very umami soup inside, & the skin is of the thickness & softness that it should be. It doesn't break easily either, so there's little to no soup wastage due to accidents.
The dumplings were filled with lots of meat, which delights me. Very value for money. The same can be said about the skin here too.
I also like how you help yourself to the ginger & vinegar at the stall, because I generally eat a mountain of ginger & less vinegar than the average person. So I can #optimize, here. 
I immediately bought some frozen ones to bring home & steam when I need a quick fix for a meal. They come in bags of 10 each - $6.50 per bag of XLB, $4.50 per bag of dumplings. Pretty competitive pricing for such excellent quality!

Was very satisfied with these steamed freshly on the spot. Had to wait 5 mins for these to be ready, but it was worth it.
I lunched here during an off-peak hour, so there was only 1 person in front of me in the queue. Normally, during peak hour there is a long line at this stall!
The XLBs had very umami soup inside, & the skin is of the thickness & softness that it should be. It doesn't break easily either, so there's little to no soup wastage due to accidents.
The dumplings were filled with lots of meat, which delights me. Very value for money. The same can be said about the skin here too.
I also like how you help yourself to the ginger & vinegar at the stall, because I generally eat a mountain of ginger & less vinegar than the average person. So I can #optimize, here. 
I immediately bought some frozen ones to bring home & steam when I need a quick fix for a meal. They come in bags of 10 each - $6.50 per bag of XLB, $4.50 per bag of dumplings. Pretty competitive pricing for such excellent quality!

the-forage-cafe-by-thirteen-honey,⭐️⭐️,"📍Verdict: 2/5 
Went down on the weekend, thinking that I could use Burpple Beyond (BB) but was told that it’s only available during weekdays. This info should have been stated clearly in the deal’s details (which it wasn’t) so that low SES ppl like me can save my trip down and pick another BB restaurant instead 😐 
Had the Smoked Salmon & Egg Waffle($17.90, pictured), Spicy Carbonara Pasta ($15.90) & Forage Signature Drink ($8.50). The Waffle was unique, well-crafted and good value for money. The portion was pretty huge as well. The pasta was a disappointment as it’s just mediocre. Don’t think that the price is justifiable as I have had better and cheaper Carbonara at 5 Senses Bistro (not a sponsored ad lol). The Drink was only 3/4 full from the mason jar which looks like someone drank a huge mouthful before it was served to us 🤔 But reading from other ppl’s review, i think that is just their serving style, which is quite weird? The Drink was meh and not worth the price.

Went down on the weekend, thinking that I could use Burpple Beyond (BB) but was told that it’s only available during weekdays. This info should have been stated clearly in the deal’s details (which it wasn’t) so that low SES ppl like me can save my trip down and pick another BB restaurant instead 😐 
Had the Smoked Salmon & Egg Waffle($17.90, pictured), Spicy Carbonara Pasta ($15.90) & Forage Signature Drink ($8.50). The Waffle was unique, well-crafted and good value for money. The portion was pretty huge as well. The pasta was a disappointment as it’s just mediocre.

I enjoyed the thick slice of salmon and the sweet mashed purple potato! I am not a big fan of the kombucha but no complaints since it came with the set.

I was expecting ondeh ondeh taste to be stronger but it wasn’t. It’s not too bad overall but there’s nothing to wow about. $9.50 for a small slice of cake + vanilla ice cream is kinda pricey. Probably wouldn’t go back again.,Jaster Ngui,@JasteRock,food,small slice of,0,,

tiger-street-lab,Snow Pear Fire Crackle Yusheng ($38.80 for 4 pax) Not your ordinary Yusheng.,"@tigerbeersg, collaborated with @dashijiabigprawnmee to create a special yusheng, which contains Tiger-infused Popping Candies and Shredded Snow Pear that give a “fire-crackling” effect and a refreshing crunch.
Besides that, diners can also enjoy great local flavours with dishes such as
• 💕 Salt Pepper Crispy Shrimps with Curry Leaves. ($14.80).
• 💕Wok-fried King Prawn White Bee Hoon. ($18.80).
• 💕Tiger-Infused Crispy Baby Sotong. ($15.80).
• 💕Pickled Garlic Fried Barramundi Fillet. ($18.80).
My fav dish is the salt pepper crispy shrimps with curry leaves. Pair it with Shiok ale (seasonal brew from Tiger Beer, a tropical medley of passionfruit and pineapples). It’s so shiok, I couldn’t stop!
Tiger Street Lab will be operating as per normal on the eve of CNY and all 15 days of Chinese New Year.

tomyum-mama,Isam Spicy Fried Crab Claw Rice 9.9nett,Really really flavourful and fragrant fried rice. Crab meat almost dissolved and coated the rice with strands so i was a little disappointed that no sizable chunks of crab meat was anywhere to be found.

tomyum-mama,"Claypot Tomyum MAMA—$12.90
Spicy level 3 and Sour level 2, this claypot has definitely level up our favourite thai tomyum MAMA noodles.","To justify the price, this comes with crab claw meat, prawn, clam, squid, minced pork and the mandatory egg. So good that we ordered a second round. Not enough for 2pax to share la! 🤣
.
Another must-try is their Grilled Moo Ping ($5.90/3pcs). Grilled minced pork that has fats in it to give that sweet patty the omph juicy bites. Pretty reasonable priced side dishes ranging from $3.90-$5.90 generally. Not forgetting thai milktea and greentea ($2.90 each). Try the Jumbo-sized milktea ($12.90) if you have the stomach space to. My advice: just go for regular-sized ones and order different flavours.

We save this place in a wishlist for some time in @burpple app. This lunch we visit the place at noon (just in time before the crowd 😇).
.
The jazz music with the retro Art Deco & musical instruments really transport us back in time. We felt so relaxed like we were in a kopi place but we are here for their Nasi Padang!! 😜
.
Get 2 vege, 1 meat for each set. First time trying chicken rendang and it's so delicious! Highly addictive tapioca leaves in mild spicy curry goes well with bergedil (potato croquette). Sambal goreng is also pretty good. The gravy pour on top of rice gives a little kick to each set. Somehow we feel that we can eat more though. If they give us more rice, we would definitely order extra Tahu Telur to share! 😅
.
Quite common to some Nasi Padang stalls, there is no bill breakdown. We paid $15.5 for 2 sets (including tea). Such a good & reasonable eat in SG that is definitely worthwhile your visit in Orchard. 🍛

warung-m-nasir,Laid Back Jazz Music Nasi Padang,"Laid back jazzy vibe Nasi Padang @ Warung M. Nasir 🎷
*****
We save this place in a wishlist for some time in @burpple app. This lunch we visit the place at noon (just in time before the crowd 😇).
.
The jazz music with the retro Art Deco & musical instruments really transport us back in time. We felt so relaxed like we were in a kopi place but we are here for their Nasi Padang!! 😜
.
Get 2 vege, 1 meat for each set. First time trying chicken rendang and it's so delicious! Highly addictive tapioca leaves in mild spicy curry goes well with bergedil (potato croquette). Sambal goreng is also pretty good. The gravy pour on top of rice gives a little kick to each set. Somehow we feel that we can eat more though. If they give us more rice, we would definitely order extra Tahu Telur to share! 😅
.
Quite common to some Nasi Padang stalls, there is no bill breakdown. We paid $15.5 for 2 sets (including tea). Such a good & reasonable eat in SG that is definitely worthwhile your visit in Orchard. 🍛

warung-m-nasir,Always YES for nasi padang!!,"Me and my sis craved for nasi padang, so we tried this interesting place.
They have so many choices to try.
I tried beef gepuk (meat with red chilli), beef rendang, and always with cassava leaves for my nasi padang. Everything taste nice but not the best actually.
The meat lil bit hard for me.
The ‘bakwan’ (veggie fritters) also looks so big and tempting but it turns out too much flour, but again tastewise it’s not bad.
Not forget to order Tea bottled too and our lunch is perfect 👌

·
Hokkien Mee - $4

Their hokkien mee is moist but not that flavourful by itself. However with their chilli is a different story all together. Their chilli paste is sweet sour spicy all at once, giving the Hokkien Mee a boost in flavours. Then there are the standard ingredients such as prawn, squid and pork slices, which are quite acceptable. Just a warning, there’s a lot of garlic bits in the dish, which I enjoyed, while some people may not. Hear say their Fried Kway Teow is quite a popular choice too
