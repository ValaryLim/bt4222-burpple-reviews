amazing-hokkaido,"High Price, Bad Service!","Really bad service. The manager (or owner) doesn’t care either. We were seated outdoors when it started to rain. The staff just stood around talking amongst themselves. The 5 staff weren’t standing far from us and I’m sure we were in plain view. We waved them over and said they needed to reseat us. Only one person set up another table under shelters for us. We had to carry our food and drinks ourselves. Had to ask one of them for help and she took 1 plate of our food. After we got seated at a new table They brought back the plate of our left over roll and the plate is still covered in rain water! I couldn’t believe they didn’t bother to change the plate. We asked to speak with the manager and when the staff reluctantly went to ask and explain the situation, she didn’t bother coming over even though we stayed on for another 30 minutes. I asked for a name card and was told to go comment on their Facebook. So here I am :) high price, terrible service. It seemed to me like they only provide service for the Japanese and doesn’t care about anyone else. Never recommending this place to anyone.",Lynn Oh,@lynnoh,food,the plate ,0,,

📍Angelina, Marina Bay Sands📍
💸 Afternoon Tea Set: $59 (for 2 pax)
💸 Emma: $15
*Prices stated above are not inclusive of GST and service charge
...
While we can’t be overseas, we can still indulge in a relaxing afternoon break at Angelina. Situated by the canal in MBS, it is an ideal spot to rest our feet, sip some chocolate and let our imagination transport us to Paris (close enough😂)✨
Here we have their afternoon tea set for 2 which comes with:
* An assortment of mini pastries
* Several savoury items
* 1 eclair - choose between raspberry, caramel or chocolate
* 2 Financiers - choose between original, chocolate and pistachio
* Choice of tea, coffee or hot chocolate
*The difference between the single and 2 pax tea set is the addition of eclair and financiers. 
Tbh, this has got to be one of the more unfriendly sharing tea set (that we’ve had)😂Unlike most high tea set, Angelina serves only 1 of each item so we had to pick which items we want and we can’t really share them as it was rather petite. On this note, we do appreciate that there isn’t an overwhelming amount of food in their tea set which may result in some form of food wastage😌 
We love the ambience, the quality of the food and for the price, it’s pretty worth it!They also have an extensive breakfast/ mains menu which we’re really intrigued by and may be back to try them someday💃",Munch Kinggs,@munchkinggs,food,"

angelina-marina-bay-sands,Afternoon Tea Set,"🍴DINE OUT🍴
📍Angelina, Marina Bay Sands📍
💸 Afternoon Tea Set: $59 (for 2 pax)
💸 Emma: $15
*Prices stated above are not inclusive of GST and service charge
...
While we can’t be overseas, we can still indulge in a relaxing afternoon break at Angelina. Situated by the canal in MBS, it is an ideal spot to rest our feet, sip some chocolate and let our imagination transport us to Paris (close enough😂)✨
Here we have their afternoon tea set for 2 which comes with:
* An assortment of mini pastries
* Several savoury items
* 1 eclair - choose between raspberry, caramel or chocolate
* 2 Financiers - choose between original, chocolate and pistachio
* Choice of tea, coffee or hot chocolate
*The difference between the single and 2 pax tea set is the addition of eclair and financiers. 
Tbh, this has got to be one of the more unfriendly sharing tea set (that we’ve had)😂Unlike most high tea set, Angelina serves only 1 of each item so we had to pick which items we want and we can’t really share them as it was rather petite. On this note, we do appreciate that there isn’t an overwhelming amount of food in their tea set which may result in some form of food wastage😌

casuarina-curry,For Banana Cheese Prata,"What's a supper guide without at least one spot for amazing roti prata? We had high hopes for the biryani, but as it turns out, pratas are still what Casuarina Curry does best. Like its original Casuarina Road location, the Macpherson outlet also stays open till midnight. You won't go wrong with the Plain Prata ($1), which is crisp on the outside and wonderfully fluffy within. If you're up for it, try not to miss the generously stuffed Banana Cheese Prata ($3.50) that comes drizzled with a sweet-salty caramel sauce — it might sound strange but it is so good! If you're hankering after something more substantial, we found the Bee Hoon Goreng ($3.50) tastier than the rice. Wash it all down with a good ol' Teh Tarik ($0.90).
Avg price: $5 per person

casuarina-curry,Curry In A Platter,"A very curry-looking meal I had on a relaxing Monday night. My first time here and here's my take:
-Try the other things beside the pratas. I ordered a plain prata and it was way over-fried :( To the extent it was a bit hard.
-The murtabuk was pleasantly surprising. It was really good. And it has a lot of meat 👍🏻 Go for that!
-The butter chicken was slightly below average with regards to the taste, but there was a lot of chicken inside despite the tiny bowl.
-Teh Aliya was 👍🏻
-Chicken curry was 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Fish curry didn't suit my liking as there was a pretty strong fish taste to it but the fiancé loved it.

Comes in individual portion, it is of reasonable size. You get to choose between a garnishing of crispy garlic or xo sauce. The finishing touch of adding alittle of the vermicelli was brilliant. Sauce was just a simple light soya sauce with a tinge of sesame oil.
I enjoyed it so much that one piece is not enough. The promo now is at $10 per razor clam.

I enjoyed it so much that one piece is not enough. The promo now is at $10 per razor clam.

Near to perfection, best tasting pork chop by far. Satisfying portion, the pork was perfectly cook, not dry hard meat. So pork lovers like me, this is a must try dish. Comes with 2 sides, not like the pork gave me a wow, but is decent overall. Coleslaw is not bad, but I think could have been better if apple small slice & raisins are added?Hahaha

jun-yuan-house-of-fish,I have been eyeing this stall at old airport road hawker centre for the longest time after it appeared in the news for helping an old man earn some money by delivering food around 1km radius around old airport.,"It took me 3 attempts before I could finally get my hands on this! First few times I was there after cycling before it opened at 11am.. the second time I reached at 8.45pm after evening cycling and they were already packing up to go home (though operation hours are till 9pm). This time round went during lunch and managed to try! (Though we tried to call the hp number a few times to pre order for self collection but the line was never picked up). This is the herbal seafood soup and it reminds me of OAR seafood soup! Both have two prawns, this use batang fish while the other uses dory fish. Both have pork balls but this stall's is much smaller than the other one. Overall I like both! go for this if you like the herbal taste in your soup! Oar seafood soup's broth is more of the milky fish soup kind. #seafoodsoup #herbalseafoodsoup #herbalsoup #junyuanhouseoffish #oldairportroadhawker #oldairporthawker #burpple

Freshly baked homebaked goodness by a pair of passionate and friendly couple. 👴👵Definitely worth the calories and time to head over to support them. 🆙️🆙️

Their crust taste like pineapple tart, really buttery.
Very delicious tarts!!😋😋 Extremely generous amount of filling in each tarts. I am totally hooked on their tarts.
.
.
Orh Nee Tart✔✔ ($1.20) - smooth, silky and natural fragrant of yam filling blended well with earthy ginkgo in the buttery crust.
Cheese Tart 🧀🧀($1.20) -the mixture of the acidity and richness of the cheesecake filling and buttery crust swirls well in my mouth👍👍
Peanut Mochi 🥜🥜($1.20) - thick and chewy Mochi with subtle sweet yam filling. Ending with a nutty fragrance by the peanut powder coating. Well, it is a huge piece of Mochi.
.
.
Head down as early as possible to avoid dissapointment or call to book in advance. I reached down by 9.30am and only 3 types of tarts available at the moments. I consider myself lucky for the day. I am pretty sure it is a third of the price compared to those fancy artisan patisserie.

Orh Nee Tart✔✔ ($1.20) - smooth, silky and natural fragrant of yam filling blended well with earthy ginkgo in the buttery crust.
Cheese Tart 🧀🧀($1.20) -the mixture of the acidity and richness of the cheesecake filling and buttery crust swirls well in my mouth👍👍
Peanut Mochi 🥜🥜($1.20) - thick and chewy Mochi with subtle sweet yam filling. Ending with a nutty fragrance by the peanut powder coating. Well, it is a huge piece of Mochi.
.
.
Head down as early as possible to avoid dissapointment or call to book in advance. I reached down by 9.30am and only 3 types of tarts available at the moments. I consider myself lucky for the day. I am pretty sure it is a third of the price compared to those fancy artisan patisserie.

Head down as early as possible to avoid dissapointment or call to book in advance. I reached down by 9.30am and only 3 types of tarts available at the moments. I consider myself lucky for the day. I am pretty sure it is a third of the price compared to those fancy artisan patisserie.

Freshly baked homebaked goodness by a pair of passionate and friendly couple. 👴👵Definitely worth the calories and time to head over to support them. 🆙️🆙️

Their crust taste like pineapple tart, really buttery.
Very delicious tarts!!😋😋 Extremely generous amount of filling in each tarts. I am totally hooked on their tarts.

Orh Nee Tart✔✔ ($1.20) - smooth, silky and natural fragrant of yam filling blended well with earthy ginkgo in the buttery crust.
Cheese Tart 🧀🧀($1.20) -the mixture of the acidity and richness of the cheesecake filling and buttery crust swirls well in my mouth👍👍
Peanut Mochi 🥜🥜($1.20) - thick and chewy Mochi with subtle sweet yam filling. Ending with a nutty fragrance by the peanut powder coating. Well, it is a huge piece of Mochi.

As much as I was hoping for a Chicken Schnitzel wrapping the veggies and sauce, the piece of chicken was just too thick to be folded, leaving the Kentaco appear like a patty with shreds of ingredients on it. The chicken itself tasted a little dry with the non-spicy batter, so add your own chilli sauce as you would deem fit.

⠀
Of course, any Japanese restaurant worth their soya sauce would have stellar sashimi, and Kumo certainly delivers on that side. The salmon, swordfish, squid & tuna sashimi I went for was fantastically fresh and gluttonously gratifying after a quick dab of wasabi & soya sauce. The cuts are a bit on the thick side, but you won’t hear this boy complaining.⠀
⠀
I sampled their mini katsudon as well and I was quite taken by it. It’s hearty, simple yet savoury, and it’s comfort food at its peak. The tempura vegetables were expertly battered & fried, but the prawns left something to be desired. The size was rather considerable, but it wasn’t fresh and it really showed. The bacon yakitori is, as expected, quite unctuous, but as a whole, the yakitori didn’t impress.⠀

Many independent & chain restaurants have the option of turning to islandwide delivery to soften the clobbering their profit margins are taking, but club & hotel restaurants have no way of mitigating the absolute bodying they’re taking right now.⠀
⠀
It’s kinda sad, because certain dining establishments at clubs or hotels, such as @one15marina Latitude Bistro, dish out some truly titillating fare. Oyster Rockefellers may be seen as some to be so last century, but they’ll always have a preeminent place in my heart and in my stomach.⠀
⠀
Latitude Bistro’s oyster rockerfellers, which are actually a weird hybrid of oyster rockerfeller & oyster mornay, are absolutely ambrosial. A P H A T oyster swaddled in spinach, soaked in a ridiculously rich butter & herb sauce, and smothered with a beautiful blanket of golden brown melted cheese. Extremely exquisite doesn’t even begin to cover just how strikingly sumptuous these shellfish were, and you can take that to the bank.⠀

lowefco,Choco PBJ ($5.50),"Pullman sandwich bread baked in-house daily, with dark chocolate, jam, peanut butter and toasted almonds. I requested for the jam on the side and they obliged as this sandwich is made to order (some are premade).
As a chocolate and PB lover, I absolutely loved this sandwich. It wasn’t too sweet thanks to the use of dark chocolate, and the addition of sliced almonds was amazing because of the crunch and nutty flavours. I think the jam might be made in house too, and it is pretty good. It’s slightly tart and not too sweet. The texture isn’t thick and goop-like unlike many sold commercially, so I did find it a nice addition to give my mouth a break from the rich and creamy peanut butter and dark chocolate from time to time.

As a chocolate and PB lover, I absolutely loved this sandwich.

I think the jam might be made in house too, and it is pretty good. It’s slightly tart and not too sweet.

lowefco,Chocolate Cherry Tart ($5),"Tarts are usually only baked on weekends or public holidays, and I was lucky to see the Chocolate Cherry Tart and Lemon Tart on display. My eyes went straight to the chocolate tart, with a contrasting half cocoa dusted layer and the precise line of cacao nibs, it was certainly gorgeous. 
Each of the tarts are handmade, and the amount of pride and hard work that goes into them are evident. The owner, Don, shared that they were made with chocolate imported from Europe and morello cherries to give that winning bitter and sour combination. The base is also made from rye which is good for the gut, so this tart is also healthier! 
The tart base holds up very nicely, and keeps its shape without crumbling even after we sliced it into 8 pieces. It is the right thickness and the taste of the chocolate tart base is on point. The chocolate filling also holds its shape well, but remains soft to the touch and melts lusciously in your mouth. I loved the rich and slightly bitter chocolate, especially the half with the cocoa dusting. The cherries do impart a certain tartness that cuts through while complementing the bitterness, and it’s an incredibly addictive combination that I couldn’t get enough of. For a small cafe that doesn’t even specialise in making tarts, I was blown away by this chocolate tart. It’s not the most polished (I do like this exterior better than the crisp smooth tarts that many patisseries sell though), but it’s the most honest to goodness and most affordable I’ve come across so far. I’d definitely recommend picking up a tart if you do see it when you visit Lowe’f, because I definitely will!",Melissa Chee,@melchee92,food,", and ",0,,

meatsmith-western-bbq,cheep chopped ,"If you can only order one thing from here, make it the Salted Egg Chicken Chop ($9). Juicy, charred chicken is slathered in a salted egg sauce the consistency of thick curry gravy – zi char taken up a couple notches?
The sauce does look different from what we’re used to, a promising mustard yellow flecked with spices, curry leaves, and who knows what else.

The sauce has bits of salted egg in it which was a nice surprise, away from the generic salted egg dishes that were either too sweet or gets a bit gelat after a few bites. The only thing that I have a gripe with is the garlic rice which can be improved further as it is lacking in seasoning and flavour.

Not really a big fan of glutinous rice, this got me eating quite a bit as it was nicely balanced and the addition of Chinese sausage, mushrooms and century eggs gives it a nice flavour.

The sauce has bits of salted egg in it which was a nice surprise, away from the generic salted egg dishes that were either too sweet or gets a bit gelat after a few bites. The only thing that I have a gripe with is the garlic rice which can be improved further as it is lacking in seasoning and flavour. On the other hand, the Smoked Suckling Pig with Glutinous Rice ($16) fared much better overall as the crispy skin on the pork was just amazing that day. Not really a big fan of glutinous rice, this got me eating quite a bit as it was nicely balanced and the addition of Chinese sausage, mushrooms and century eggs gives it a nice flavour.

mona-lounge,Mona's Tea ($22).,"""At that red teahouse, we finally exchange vows"". This intimate space transports you to the glamourous period of 1980s Hong Kong with mahjong tables and cosy leather seats, but it's hidden from public view. Access can be requested at Sum Yi Tai, where you ask to see Mona and be presented with a unique code for a locked door that leads to Mona Lounge; or via reservations at drink@monalounge.com where the passcode will be provided upon confirmation.
🔸
And this cocktail gives you a glimpse into Mona's past. The modernised Asian cocktail menu combines the expertise of Head Bartender Byron Tan and Group Chief Bartender Sam Wong. I started my cocktail journey here with this Mona’s Tea, a cognac-based cocktail made with oolong PX sherry and Fernet Branca, beautifully presented in a teacup. Served with salted egg chocolate made by Singapore’s own craft chocolatier Fossa Chocolate, the sweetness from the cognac is perfectly balanced with the bitterness of the Fernet Branca, elevated with a touch of oolong PX sherry.
🔸
I've also tried 3 other cocktails here, as I had the lovely company of Mona Lounge owners Eu Yen and Sandra who wanted me to try a couple of their favorite drinks. I found that they are sufficiently complex yet very well balanced. This would be one of my favourite places to come for a drink after work. Moreover, the ambience here is perfect to have a drink by yourself, and it's chill enough to hold conversations with a friend.

I had the fish this time as the Pork Katsu always felt too heavy. I was really surprised by how nicely crispy it was on the outside and how soft and juicy the fish was on the inside. Will definitely be ordering the fish again.
I opted for the level 2 spice and it was enough to make my tongue tingle and my nose run a little.

This serving includes pork katsu, tempura, fried dory and pork shabu-shabu. Spiciness has levels and indicated through how many hearts of red sauce they put. Ours was just Level 1. We're weak! 😝 Filling but not that impressive. If you're that kind who wants to just feel full, this is for you. But if you're after the flavour, experience and quality, reconsider having this.

First, the kalguksu. The first thought that came to my mind when it was served was that I definitely overpaid for it. The soup was fairly light, without much substance to it. For the first minutes the noodles were quite chewy and had a nice mouth feel to them. However, they quickly lost their structure and became a mushy mess. The shredded chicken was also poorly integrated into the dish, and even had bones leftover in them.
Next, the naengmyeon. The noodles were rather on point. Although they looked like they were beehoon noodles, they were actually quite chewy, exactly how you expect your naengmyeon noodles to be like. However, the soup left much to be desired. It was kinda plain, and not soup enough. They do however provide you with vinegar so you can adjust to your tastes. They also provide mustard.

Salmon and Soba (warm) at Old Hen Kitchen...
Moist and tender salmon with crispy skin and warm soba, tasty! Find it a little salty but otherwise, this is great!😋
As for the portobello aglio olio, my friend had a special request to go without the bacon, the taste is good but she find it a little spicy for her...
Moving on to their drinks, their white is good too! They got their coffee beans from Nylon Coffee Roasters and the one I had is a little towards fruity taste, not bad at all!☕️
As for their bottled matcha milk, I like it as it is not-that-sweet, with a hint of matcha’s bitterness, but do expect the very rich milky taste since this is a matcha MILK okay~🍵
The open-concept kitchen allows us to have a preview of how our food is being prepared but I prefer to sit a little further away from the kitchen so as to avoid getting the smell stuck on me...🙊
Like how the cafe setting is, filled with paintings and plants (instagram props)...🤣
The service is good, the staff served us politely with smile and making us feel welcomed! 
Not like some of the cafes which clear your plates quickly once you are done and checking you out on-and-off (that kind of pressure to hint you to leave) or might as well ask if you can give up your seats for other diners directly...
Instead of chasing us away after we are done with our meal, the staff actually replenished the bottle of plain water on our table as we chatted our time away...
Overall, for the food, coffee, ambience and service, I will be back again!
Damage: $19 (Salmon and Soba) + $19 Portobello Aglio Olio + $4.50 (White) + $7 (Bottled Matcha Milk)

Moving on to their drinks, their white is good too! They got their coffee beans from Nylon Coffee Roasters and the one I had is a little towards fruity taste, not bad at all!☕️
As for their bottled matcha milk, I like it as it is not-that-sweet, with a hint of matcha’s bitterness, but do expect the very rich milky taste since this is a matcha MILK okay~🍵
The open-concept kitchen allows us to have a preview of how our food is being prepared but I prefer to sit a little further away from the kitchen so as to avoid getting the smell stuck on me...🙊
Like how the cafe setting is, filled with paintings and plants (instagram props)...🤣
The service is good, the staff served us politely with smile and making us feel welcomed! 
Not like some of the cafes which clear your plates quickly once you are done and checking you out on-and-off (that kind of pressure to hint you to leave) or might as well ask if you can give up your seats for other diners directly...
Instead of chasing us away after we are done with our meal, the staff actually replenished the bottle of plain water on our table as we chatted our time away...
Overall, for the food, coffee, ambience and service, I will be back again!
Damage: $19 (Salmon and Soba) + $19 Portobello Aglio Olio + $4.50 (White) + $7 (Bottled Matcha Milk)

You don't even need much sauce to go with the meat! However, the soup isn't too good.
They have an interesting fried porridge ($5) that is probably one of a kind as they basically light up the porridge in flames in the wok to give it the distinct smoky taste. This is probably not for everyone, but I do find it rather flavourful.

I loved every course that was served but I believe the chu toro with shoyu foam was a unanimous favourite with the very interesting texture from the savoury foam that worked so well with the sufficiently fatty chutoro.
The other nigiri sushi were damn good too - Sea bream w truffle shoyu, shima yuzu, kanpachi, ika with sesame, torched alfonsino, akami, chu toro with shoyu foam, shime saba, torched salmon with truffle soya (which chef proclaimed will dissolve, not just melt in your mouth and it was 👍🏼!!) Also had a seemingly simple but very satisfyingly tasty sweet kani handroll with truffle, wrapped with crisp seaweed.
Not only was the seafood fresh with every element well-thought for a medley of flavours and textures in each course with seasoning done right without distracting one from the freshness, the rice is a very important part and it was done well here.

ryo-sushi,Not sure of what to order at the Japanese restaurant?,"Leave it to the chef at @ryosushisg Omakase takes the tedious task selection off your hands, leaving you, the customer, looking forward to each dish.
Being uni lovers, we went for the 18-course sea urchin menu.
The three bowls of starters serves to whet your appetite and awaken your taste buds as you await for the main dishes to be served.
Each of the premium sushi was carefully prepared with different seasonings that provide a different overall taste to the usual sushis in restaurants. While the ingredients enough was good enough (the fatty tuna really melts in your mouth), the seasonings kick it up a notch to bring your taste buds to different level of euphoria.
The handroll contained a generous amount of crabmeat - to the extent that I was tasting crabmeat with almost every bite!
I enjoyed the small sea urchin bowl tremendously, with its generous amount of uni mixed in with the rice (the rice grains are coated with uni!) The ikura gives that bursting goodness which prevents your taste bud from getting excessively sick (jerlat) of the same taste being repeated over and over in your mouth. Very nice touch, I must say.
And of course, who doesn’t enjoy a warm bowl of soup? The last dish to the course helps to calm down those excited tastebuds while bringing warmth and comfort to the tummy.
That was definitely 1.5 hours well-spent and well-digested. Good value for money, considering how costly omakase meals usually are and the amount of unis that were consumed that night. Be warned though, for this is not your usual Singaporean rush hour fanfare. #singapore #sgfood #sgfoodie #singaporefoodie #singapore2018 #sgig #igsg #sgeats #STfoodtrendy #mysingapore #hungrygowhere #instasg #whati8todaysg #whati8today #foodporn #onthetable #foodreviews #tripadvisor #groman #gromanfood #burpple",DARRELL G.Ro_man,@gro_man,food,it to the ,0,,

At Little India and fancy some good North Indian meal?","Here's sakunthala's food palace to satisfy your taste buds. 😍

Butter chicken, with tandoori inside mixed with butter chicken sauce. The sauce was really thick, and when you mix your garlic naan or papadum inside it makes a great combination. Garlic naan was chewy, but rather small I must say. Next we have the plain thosai, I loved how unique the texture was, and it was actually my first time trying it, so I really find that a unique one. Their special briyani had long grain rice and lots of other side dishes to go along with it! 🤗

tambuah-mas,Indonesian Home Style Cuisine,"This was a lunch menu catered for some students we were hosting. 
The tahu telur (bottom right corner) was definitely a major highlight. Cubes of egg tofu were deep fried to a crispy golden brown and topped with a halo of deep fried egg white. It was doused with some a thick, sweet and spicy dark sauce. The combination of silky tofu and deep fried batter was heavenly. The egg white halo soaked up the sauce and turned it into dripping strings of deliciousness which I ate like noodles. And that delightfully savory sauce coated everything with its perfect balance of sweetness and tanginess. 
Another highlight was their signature fried chicken (top right corner). Served piping hot, the strong whiff of Indonesian spices shone through with every bite. The breast meat was not dry but instead tore apart easily, and the meat inside glistened with chicken juice. I was so impressed because it wasn't the least bit oily despite its delightful crispiness.
Finally, their chendol which (not pictured here) finished off our delicious meal with a bang. Served with coconut milk and gula melaka with bits of sago spooned into the bottom, it was sweet, rich and the perfect respite from Singapore's heat.
All in all, really delicious, authentic, well-executed Indonesian food with familiar, time-tested flavors. I loved the food here.

The tahu telur (bottom right corner) was definitely a major highlight. Cubes of egg tofu were deep fried to a crispy golden brown and topped with a halo of deep fried egg white. It was doused with some a thick, sweet and spicy dark sauce. The combination of silky tofu and deep fried batter was heavenly. The egg white halo soaked up the sauce and turned it into dripping strings of deliciousness which I ate like noodles. And that delightfully savory sauce coated everything with its perfect balance of sweetness and tanginess. 
Another highlight was their signature fried chicken (top right corner). Served piping hot, the strong whiff of Indonesian spices shone through with every bite. The breast meat was not dry but instead tore apart easily, and the meat inside glistened with chicken juice. I was so impressed because it wasn't the least bit oily despite its delightful crispiness.
Finally, their chendol which (not pictured here) finished off our delicious meal with a bang. Served with coconut milk and gula melaka with bits of sago spooned into the bottom, it was sweet, rich and the perfect respite from Singapore's heat.
All in all, really delicious, authentic, well-executed Indonesian food with familiar, time-tested flavors. I loved the food here.

-> salmon(+$2), brown rice, avocado(+$1), chickpeas, edamame, furikake(some seaweed thing) and pesto vinaigrett dressing
•the place is really easy to find. Its just around the left end of the MRT exit near boost, royce's row
•you can choose the portion you want: petite, regular, large, and xtra large to suit your appetite so you won't waste money not finishing it and feel satisfied.
•the edamame I chose is really nice. They mixed some chili sauce(its not spicy at all) to add flavour
•the salmon is really well cooked and they are very generous to give 2 pc
•the brown rice is quite nice too, I don't know how to describe

the-wine-gourmet-friends,[The Wine & Gourmet Friends] - Foie Gras Lotus Rice ($18).,"Foie Gras and rice to me is an unusual combination but the chemistry between these two ingredients was better than expected. Perhaps the idea came from replacing liver with foie gras (just guessing), the role of foie gras in the rice was like that of a stir-fried pork liver but with an additional creamy texture. It was seared to attain a slight crisp on its surface, which released a layer of sweet gaminess into the savoury rice. Being the centerpiece of a dish usually, it did not steal any limelight from the lotus leaf rice, which was just as outstanding on its own. Fragrant with oriental seasoning and condiments, Calrose rice is used instead of glutinous rice to lighten the load from your stomach. Glutinous rice would certainly be too soft and sweet for this dish to succeed. I love the chopped porcini and shiitake mushrooms, and the Chinese X.O. sausage which added another dimension of flavours and texture. The fried lotus chips were not necessary, as they turned greasy towards the end.

the-wine-gourmet-friends,[The Wine & Gourmet Friends] - Foie Gras Lotus Rice ($18).,"Foie Gras and rice to me is an unusual combination but the chemistry between these two ingredients was better than expected. Perhaps the idea came from replacing liver with foie gras (just guessing), the role of foie gras in the rice was like that of a stir-fried pork liver but with an additional creamy texture. It was seared to attain a slight crisp on its surface, which released a layer of sweet gaminess into the savoury rice. Being the centerpiece of a dish usually, it did not steal any limelight from the lotus leaf rice, which was just as outstanding on its own. Fragrant with oriental seasoning and condiments, Calrose rice is used instead of glutinous rice to lighten the load from your stomach. Glutinous rice would certainly be too soft and sweet for this dish to succeed. I love the chopped porcini and shiitake mushrooms, and the Chinese X.O. sausage which added another dimension of flavours and texture. The fried lotus chips were not necessary, as they turned greasy towards the end.

Not a fan of the warm bed of rice underneath; always found it to be a weird temperature contrast with the raw fish over the top, though the rice also comes with a lightly savoury sauce for some flavour. The Ikura helps to add a umami burst as it pops in the mouth; a pretty decent Donburi spot that is conveniently located in the neighbourhood — not the best, but quality here is pretty respectable to say the least.",Xing Wei Chua,@the_xw,food,lightly savoury sauce for ,1,food,food
wtf-coffeehouse-and-bar,The Only Draft Beer is Archipelago ,"There are so few reviews of 9² Coffee House & Bar online, none of which were extremely recent-- most are from when they were still called WTF Coffee House & Bar. So right before I dropped by, I actually called them to ask if they exist. (I usually Facebook message, but they weren't responsive on Facebook) & I am glad they do, because I was pleasantly surprised by my food & I'd very much like to return again 😁
However, something that disappointed me a little was the beers available on tap - 9² only has Archipelago draft beer. The rest of their menu consists of bottled beer. Archipelago isn't bad, but when you are just in That Mood where you're on the hunt for new/craft beers fresh from the tap... This wouldn't cut it. No matter though, for there are other watering holes nearby for those days.
Indoor seating is very limited so you'll more likely than not have to sit outside. Not a problem in this wintery weather that Singapore is experiencing right now, but it will be an issue if mother nature starts raining down on you. ☔
