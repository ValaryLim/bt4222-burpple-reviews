Then had breakfast at one of the better brunch places in Singapore - enter Sarnies, before walking to Chinatown and have my Singaporean Kopi after a milky, cafe masala chai latte. This was not before stopping by this non descript chiffon and roll cake stall which had Dr Leslie Tay‚Äôs article displayed- at $1.80 per slice of chiffon I found this one of the softest chiffons I‚Äôve had and was very pleased. 
At Chinatown complex food centre I had only space for desserts so the chendol that Our Grandfather Story featured we had to try. It was a good bowl of chendol at $2 considering how the slightly savoury pandan tadpole jellies are handmade. 
But my win for the day was Xin Xuan‚Äôs Min Chiang Kueh, I love pancakes so corollary, I love Chinese pancakes. The ones here are soft and delicious that it made me feel like they were everything I could have ever wanted.

Definitely had to try the Thai boat noodles since it was a specialty. We ordered a regular bowl of the pork Thai boat noodles and were served a flavorful bowl of pork broth, which was a little savoury, a little bloody-metallic and actually, quite sweet. For noodles, there was a choice of rice noodles or kway teow. Love the consistency and texture of the rice noodles, makes chewing even more enjoyable.

sin-chew-satay-bee-hoon,Sin Chew Satay Bee Hoon ($6 large),"Pull up the beehoon and soft strands of white emerges from peanut gravy, picking up the creamy thick consistency well. So smooth on your tongue, it's gentle on satay spice and the fragrance of nuts with virtually no oil. More savoury than sweet, light on the heat, it carries notes of curry, giving you deep umami without being cloying. Take it in with the soft chew of cured cuttlefish, a slice of lean pork or their succulent prawns and cockles, fresh and cooked pink. Pair your mouthful with crunchy beansprouts and Kang Kong or tau pok that top it off.

Price: $12-15
I think it‚Äôs really damn expensive for craft beer in a hawker center:/ I do appreciate the interesting range of beers ( the cup states young master brewery which is from Hong Kong‚ú®) but in consideration of the growing presence of craft beer culture in Singapore, the price does not give it an edge above the rest.","As I was sitting far away from the stall, i got to choose the takeaway option or return the cup after.

starbucks-34,Teatime with Starbucks: Tuna Shepard's Pie,"Starbucks Christmas Promotional item: Tuna Shepard's Pie ($6.20) was exactly what you would expect it to be. Hearty mix of Tuna, sweetcorn, sliced carrots and peas encased in Starbucks buttery pie crust and topped off with a layer of mashed potatoes.
I enjoyed the light teatime treat as the pie was warm and comforting yet not too filling. Since Starbucks changed their deep dish beef pie to have potatoes > cheese, I don't have a pie to go to anymore and see myself visiting them less. Now with this pie in the options, I might be more regular.... Pie to Price ratio though, rather steep to be having too often.

starbucks-hillion-mall,#majorthrowback: Kouign Amann with a cup of warm hot chocolate from @starbuckssg on a rainy weekend morning.,"Personally felt that the kouign amann was dry and it did not have the buttery fragrance that I expected. I guess that‚Äôs coz I had a better one previously so this was a disappointment for me. The hot chocolate is warm and comforting on a colder morning because of the initial taste of the rich cocoa but after a while the sweetness of it makes it a bit too heavy. I honestly would prefer it to be more bitter instead as I would like the cocoa taste to linger longer and not get overwhelmed by the sugar. Probably opting for the tall sized option in future.

starbucks-hillion-mall,White Chocolate Mocha Frappucino,"Venti size- $8.70! But fret not! The 1-1 happy hour is back, which is the only time I splurge on Starbucks üòÅ
This is my go-to drink when I'm having a sweet tooth as it is rather sweet, given that it is white chocolate. I prefer dark chocolate but the Dark Mocha has those infernal chips which stick to the most unreachable crevices of your teeth.

starbucks-hillion-mall,Coconut White Mocha Macchiato ,"I tried the iced one before so this was unexpectedly different from that. The hot drink had frothy coconut milk foam on top which was rather enjoyable. After the while, the foam blended into the coffee and there was a nice mild coconutty taste throughout. If you don't like that, good to avoid this. Don't regard this as a healthier option because it's way too sweet to be healthy and coconut milk is truly not much healthier than normal milk. It's quite fatty, too. A great option for those with lactose sensitivity or intolerance!

super-simple-1,"[Super Simple+] - Build your own Small, Medium or Large box (prices start from $9.90).","My customised Large Box looked amazing. Using rump cap, the Beef Steak is by far the tastier beef I had for a protein bowl - tender with flavourful fats, and it remained easy on the jaws even after it had sat there for a while. For the base, I highly recommend Bulghur Wheat. It has the lovely, chewy bite of barley and the aromatic fragrance of brown rice. The supplements shine in their own right too. Using minimal processing to allow the natural flavours of the ingredients to shine doesn't mean merely slicing and dicing them and toss them into the salad. Still, it can also be using the best way to bring out their best, such as the house-pickled beetroot and roasted pineapple. For condiments, I reckon the fresh and fragrant Petite Herb Mix, comprising chervil, tarragon and dill will best suit the Salmon or Wild-caught Barramundi, or even the Beef Steak. To add some crunch and nuttiness into your salad, the spiced Dukkah will be ideal, especially if you have a vegetarian-protein pan-fried miso-glazed tofu.

tasty-court-by-chef-pung,Stewed Rice Vermicelli in Seafood and Supreme Stock ($16++),"Recently, I stumbled upon ‚ÄúTasty Court by Chef Pung‚Äù, a Chinese restaurant.
Tucked away inside Opera Estate, the unofficial name of the residential neighbourhood in Siglap that has roads named after famous operas, it is smallish in size but offers a respectable selection of dishes.
Since there were only two of us, and most of the dishes come in one standard serving size, I decided two items would be enough for our lunch. Turns out they‚Äòre generously apportioned and could have fed up to four people comfortably.
Anyway, pictured above is the ‚ÄúStewed Rice Vermicelli in Seafood and Supreme Stock‚Äù. The striking golden colour of the broth took me by surprise but it was very tasty and thus, so was the ‚Äúbeehoon‚Äù as those strands of vermicelli were a natural sponge. Besides pieces of prawns and fish, there were mushroom in there as well. Although the dish had a lot of flavour, I did enjoy it even more with sliced red chillies. T.H. on the other hand, preferred pickled green chillies with it.",Veronica Phua,@veronicaphua,portion,standard serving ,0,portion,portion
tasty-court-by-chef-pung,Bold Tasting Vegetables ($14++),"If you like your vegetables full of flavour rather than simple and clean, this tasty version will suit you. It has three types of vegetables stirfried with fresh Chinese yam in a lightly spicy X.O. sauce. Best eaten with plain rice.",Veronica Phua,@veronicaphua,food,plain rice ,0,food,
tasty-court-by-chef-pung,Today's lunch was surprisingly amazing.,"‚óΩ‚óæ
We went for the 5-course set lunch ($38++ min. 2 pax) as recommended by Mr. Kim, co-partner of the restaurant. This dish is the 4th course. Seafood beehoon in superior stock. Soft beehoon immersed in a very rich and creamy broth. Smooth consistency, abit salty but yet had a umami finish as I slurped spoonful after spoonful. Seafood was indeed fresh. I later found out that the base of the broth was from the humble carrot. Who knew, right? This was really good. And just look at the golden yellow color. Yummy to the last drop.
‚óΩ‚óæ
This restaurant is so hidden, smack right in a private residential estate. Not a very big place. Service is very good. If you intend to visit, reservations in advance is highly recommended.

Insincere, cowardly, unapologetic and a disgrace to the human race. I understand that he doesn't want to lose his job but giving a sincere apology was the least he could do. He was lucky that we let him off with just some chiding, without asking him to pay a compensation fee. It was enough drama for the day and not worth the extra rise in blood pressure.

the-single-cask,"The Octomore 10YO, 2016 Second Limited Release.","Nose: Sweet vanilla and cotton candy. White grapes and green apple. Not as smoky as I would expect an octomore to be.
Taste: The peat is more noticeable. Oily, smoky, oaky, marshmallow and bitter oranges.
Finish: Dry, smoky and ashy. Long lasting.
A well-rounded dram definitely.

A great flight, with my favourite being the Fettercairn 875.
The nose is very grainy. Silver polish. Malt. Peach and oranges with loads of floral elements.
Oily on the palate. Very malty. Dried fruits and a hint of honey.
The finish is medium long and a little spicy with a hint of oak.

Pizza was decent but nothing to shout about, understand that they are going for a thin crust approach but we felt that the cheese and pizza sauce was a bit too little.
Confit of Duck was better than we expected. First few mouthful were a delight but as it was cream based and very rich so it became difficult to down it after the first few spoons.

wado-dining,I‚Äôm Gonna Be Shellfish With These Cakes,"The crab cake is comfortably the more popular appetiser option on @wadodining menu, as expected. Sure, the crabby duo look kinda small & paltry in size, but do bear in mind that you‚Äôve most likely downed a bowl of soup before this, plus you‚Äôve got a full sized main course coming right up. And that‚Äôs not to mention dessert. All things considered, the portion size of the crab cakes are adroitly allocated.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
As momma always said, it‚Äôs what‚Äôs inside that counts, right? Well, yes. A creamy concoction of crabmeat cooked in a rich beÃÅchamel stuffs the crispy, deep fried casing to the gills. Yep, it‚Äôs pretty much a croquette. The crabcakes should‚Äôve been fried for about 30 seconds longer, or in hotter oil. It was a little unappealingly pale on the plate, and one expects a little deeper shade of golden brown on a deep fried croquette.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Like many of the other savoury items on the menu, I found the crab mixture within to be bland, and it was mostly creamy without much flavour. However, unlike the rest of the savouries, I didn‚Äôt mind it as much. Why, you ask? Well, the smidge of chili crab mayonnaise applied to the plate was a stroke of sheer inspiration. It‚Äôs a great example of how to adeptly infuse well loved local flavours into a western classic without any element feeling out of place.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
The chili crab mayo was almost a dead ringer for the chili crab sauces you‚Äôd get at an excellent Chinese seafood restaurant, with its brilliantly balanced sweet & savoury essences, and a slight but noticable sour tone at the back. Boosted by the creaminess of the mayonnaise base, this is a uniquely umami sauce. Shame there wasn‚Äôt quite enough of it, but what you do get is rather redolent.‚†Ä

Your last few days to grab some exclusive handmade pasta from Waterfall Ristorante Italiano at @shangrilasg , by Mamma Ria and Papa Micheabgelo, parents of the restaurant manager, Andreano Carbotti!","For one week only, this collaboration features homemade pasta as authentic as you can get it in town. The duo from Italy üáÆüáπ are here to share some of their modest authentic recipes from their hometown. This is one of the pasta I had the chance to savour that evening, Signature Homemade Cavatelli with Saut√©ed Seafood in Tomato Sauce ($38++), which had a great bite, with al dente cooked elongated shape pasta with a hollow cavity that complemented the tomato base sauce with local seafood. If you are up to taste Italy without having to fly over, trust me this is as close as it gets. So delicious, you just might bump into me if you dine there this weekend!

Valid till the 2nd of Dec (Sunday) for both lunch and dinner, enjoy the comforts of these amazing handmade dishes in the posh comforts of the restaurant.
‚Ä¢
One of my personal favourites would be the Orrechiette Pasta con Wagyu Ragu e Scaglie Di Parmigiana ($38++). The homemade orrechiette, or usually known as the ear pasta, has a nice bite and scoops up bits of the Wagyu stock that comes with the dish. This way, not only do you get to enjoy the braised stockyard Australian wagyu on its own, but the essence of it as well.
‚Ä¢
If you‚Äôre looking for something light, you can try the Trottole con Melanzane Grigliate Ricotta E Basilico ($32++). Trottole Pasta comes as little twisted ribbons, cooked with grilled eggplant which melts in your mouth, and topped with ricotta cream and basil.
‚Ä¢
Alternatively, the Cavatelli Con frutti Di Mare ($35++), is a loaded seafood dish packed with a punch. If you‚Äôre a seafood lover, you‚Äôd definitely enjoy this.
‚Ä¢
Before you dive into all that, a perfect Italian starter would be their Capocollo DOP di Martina Franca servito con Burrata Tomato Datterino e Lattuga Romana ($32++). Fresh burrata cheese that bursts upon impact is paired with juicy sliced up cherry tomatoes, cold cuts and romaine lettuce; something simply yet oh-so-delicious.
‚Ä¢
All these are only valid for a short period as Mamma Ria will be heading back soon! They do take reservations, so do call up the restaurant or email them!

Alternatively, the Cavatelli Con frutti Di Mare ($35++), is a loaded seafood dish packed with a punch. If you‚Äôre a seafood lover, you‚Äôd definitely enjoy this.
‚Ä¢
Before you dive into all that, a perfect Italian starter would be their Capocollo DOP di Martina Franca servito con Burrata Tomato Datterino e Lattuga Romana ($32++). Fresh burrata cheese that bursts upon impact is paired with juicy sliced up cherry tomatoes, cold cuts and romaine lettuce; something simply yet oh-so-delicious.
‚Ä¢
All these are only valid for a short period as Mamma Ria will be heading back soon! They do take reservations, so do call up the restaurant or email them!

One of my personal favourites would be the Orrechiette Pasta con Wagyu Ragu e Scaglie Di Parmigiana ($38++). The homemade orrechiette, or usually known as the ear pasta, has a nice bite and scoops up bits of the Wagyu stock that comes with the dish. This way, not only do you get to enjoy the braised stockyard Australian wagyu on its own, but the essence of it as well.

While some customers may think the portion is not fantastic, but there were ingredients of fresh prawns from Thailand, cuttlefish slices, strips of tender pork belly and crispy pork lard prepared fresh.
The prawn noodles were gooey and wet, absorbed some of the rich prawn stock, though not to the point when the umami-fairies would descend on the taste-buds. But good stuff.
Perhaps it was because I went relatively early to avoid peak hours, the wok-hei could have been a lot stronger.

ya-kun-kaya-toast-313-somerset,For Kaya Toast and Soft-Boiled Eggs,"As many Singaporeans will attest to, nothing hits the spot in the mornings quite like kaya (coconut jam) toast, soft boiled eggs and a hot beverage. Kaya toast shops are aplenty, and like most dishes, locals each have their favourite. A well-known chain in town, Ya Kun has various locations, one of which is in the heart of the Orchard shopping district at 313@Somerset. Come by for breakfast or tea before or in between trawling the shops. The classic Kaya Butter Toast Set ($4.80) comes with four thin pieces of toast, soft-boiled eggs (best enlivened with pepper and drizzles of black soy sauce) and a hot coffee or tea (known as kopi or teh). The star is no doubt the thinly sliced bread, toasted on a charcoal grill till crisp, then slathered with luscious kaya and sandwiched with a thin slab of chilled butter. Pro tip: Here's a trick to ordering your kopi or teh like a local. Say ""siew dai"" if you like it less sweet, ""gao"" if you like it stronger and ""peng"" if you want it iced (usually at an extra charge).

yong-xiang-xing-tou-fu,Heritage Yong Tau Foo Stall Has Super Long Queues!,"Watch the video review of the stall here: https://youtu.be/bA7_WtnbUyg
This yong tau foo (ytf) stall has been in existence since the food centre began operations in the 1970s and at the exact same spot. 
You‚Äôll know which stall it is by the long snaking queue of people that queue up for it before its opening at 1pm. You don‚Äôt get to pick and choose the ytf items, but they are all excellently well-made as the fish paste is wonderfully smooth and springy. Tofu items have a certain smoothness, and the soup has a nice blend of pork and soybean stock flavours. 
They also serve their ytf as a set with no changes and with soup and with no rice or noodles ($4.50). A tip: if you want a second bowl, you don't have to re-queue. Just ask one of the staff (usually a lady) who will take your order and money.
The other interesting fact here is that chopped fermented beans are added into the spicy-and-sour chilli sauce which explains its complex savouriness.
A big thing to note is that every item ‚Äî the taste of the soup and the fish paste ‚Äî comes more savoury as compared to the other ytf stalls here, so if you‚Äôre a bit sensitive towards saltiness, you might want to stay clear. When you look at the average age of their clientele, you‚Äôll understand why. The majority of patrons are in their 50s, 60s and older (biologically speaking, food tastes blander the older you get). So Yong Xiang Xing Dou Fu is not upping the savouriness on purpose, they are simply catering to their clientele.",Gregory Leow,@77552,food,of the ,0,,

Pictured are what I had during a dinner there:
* Dips Platter ($28) ‚Äì an appetizer consisting of five home-made dips: tzatziki, hummus, tirokafteri (spicy sheep feta cheese spread with chillis), melitzanosalata (roasted eggplant and banana peppers simmered in olive oil), and taramasalata (cured cod roe sauce with olive oil and lemon juice), served with pita bread.
* Chef Salad ($20) ‚Äì Not your usual salad, this came with a combination of avocado, cucumber, celery, quinoa, red onion, pistachio, and tomato in balsamico orange dressing. Overall, a lot of sharpness and crunch.
* Lamb Kleftiko ($36) ‚Äì Tender and non-gamey. This uses New Zealand lamb marinated in Mediterranean herbs, vegetables, garlic and lemon juice, before being slow-roasted till tender.
* Htapothi Sti Skhara ($30) ‚Äì Tender octopus with strong grilled smokiness. The octopus is first tenderised by beating it with a smooth rock, then rubbed with the rock in a circular motion. The smokiness was achieved by slow grilling the octopus over low-burning charcoal.
* Greek Baklava ($12) ‚Äì A sweet flaky pastry made of layers of filo, filled with chopped nuts, and held together with honey.

This restaurant is located in Clarke Quay, along the waterfront of Singapore River. Very idyllic location.

* Chef Salad ($20) ‚Äì Not your usual salad, this came with a combination of avocado, cucumber, celery, quinoa, red onion, pistachio, and tomato in balsamico orange dressing. Overall, a lot of sharpness and crunch.
* Lamb Kleftiko ($36) ‚Äì Tender and non-gamey. This uses New Zealand lamb marinated in Mediterranean herbs, vegetables, garlic and lemon juice, before being slow-roasted till tender.
* Htapothi Sti Skhara ($30) ‚Äì Tender octopus with strong grilled smokiness. The octopus is first tenderised by beating it with a smooth rock, then rubbed with the rock in a circular motion. The smokiness was achieved by slow grilling the octopus over low-burning charcoal.
* Greek Baklava ($12) ‚Äì A sweet flaky pastry made of layers of filo, filled with chopped nuts, and held together with honey.

zorba-the-greek-taverna,"Still fresh from my recent visit to 1-V:U under the 1-Group, I visited Zorba under the same parent company.","This means they now have a Greek restaurant to add to their existing portfolio that includes iconic establishments such as 1-Altitude, Stellar, The Summerhouse, TXA and UNA at the Alkaff Mansion.

Pictured are what I had during a dinner there:
* Dips Platter ($28) ‚Äì an appetizer consisting of five home-made dips: tzatziki, hummus, tirokafteri (spicy sheep feta cheese spread with chillis), melitzanosalata (roasted eggplant and banana peppers simmered in olive oil), and taramasalata (cured cod roe sauce with olive oil and lemon juice), served with pita bread.
* Chef Salad ($20) ‚Äì Not your usual salad, this came with a combination of avocado, cucumber, celery, quinoa, red onion, pistachio, and tomato in balsamico orange dressing. Overall, a lot of sharpness and crunch.
* Lamb Kleftiko ($36) ‚Äì Tender and non-gamey. This uses New Zealand lamb marinated in Mediterranean herbs, vegetables, garlic and lemon juice, before being slow-roasted till tender.
* Htapothi Sti Skhara ($30) ‚Äì Tender octopus with strong grilled smokiness. The octopus is first tenderised by beating it with a smooth rock, then rubbed with the rock in a circular motion. The smokiness was achieved by slow grilling the octopus over low-burning charcoal.
* Greek Baklava ($12) ‚Äì A sweet flaky pastry made of layers of filo, filled with chopped nuts, and held together with honey.
