I ordered the beer batterd fish and chips ($15.90) with fries, salad and their homemade tartar sauce. The fish was very crispy but is quite crumbly when I cut it up. Could not really taste the beer batter but the homemade tartar sauce made up for it. Not of a bad dish but would love to try other dishes on their menu.

Some people eat it for the spicy soup, a handful might like it for the cockles and others like me, eat it for the tau pok (fried beancurd puff)! The tau pok that has been so well cooked in the Laksa soup that it has absorbed all that tasty broth into itself, one that will reward you with a burst of the glorious spicy broth with every bite!

If you are one of those who cannot care less about the cockles and enjoys the tau pok and spicy broth in a Laksa, I think you will like @greendotsg 's Vegetarian Laksa (SGD 5.90).
🌶
Though Green Dot's spicy broth does not have dried shrimps and consequently lack a little umami flavor, it still manages to be tasty. Spice level is moderate and for those who wants an extra kick, chopped chillies are available on the side so don't worry.

The tau pok that has been so well cooked in the Laksa soup that it has absorbed all that tasty broth into itself, one that will reward you with a burst of the glorious spicy broth with every bite!
🌶
If you are one of those who cannot care less about the cockles and enjoys the tau pok and spicy broth in a Laksa, I think you will like @greendotsg 's Vegetarian Laksa (SGD 5.90).
🌶
Though Green Dot's spicy broth does not have dried shrimps and consequently lack a little umami flavor, it still manages to be tasty. Spice level is moderate and for those who wants an extra kick, chopped chillies are available on the side so don't worry.
🌶
Oh ya, and in case you are wondering if vermicelli, tau pok, bean sprouts and mushrooms are all you get from this bowl, hidden inside are some mock prawns and sotong balls. But I don't think anyone cares much about these. At least I don't.

guo-fu-steamboat,Full Steam Ahead,"All I’m sayin is, y’all had no idea how delighted I was when the hotpot buffets reopened. Sure, there ain’t no more sauce bar thanks to the corona, but you get a waitress coming over with a condiment cart at the press of a button. I ain’t pressed, I actually quite like the tableside service.⠀
⠀
Guo Fu Steamboat has been on my must try list for the longest time, and my gaaawwwddd it’s the perfect first post lockdown hotpot buffet. The lunch buffet is reasonable enough at $25.90++, and you get free flow EVERYTHING for two hours straight. Yes, even the xiao long baos. Of course, some things are far more worthy of your stomach’s real estate than others, and the special pork on the left & the premium beef on the right are undeniably worthy. Just look at the marbling, man. That’s decent quality right there.⠀
⠀
Unfortunately, the soup bases incur an additional charge, and my choice of the (Super) Male Vitality Soup was an extra seven bucks. Still, service is stellar for a hotpot place, and Guo Fu’s individual hotpots are certainly the new meta during this coronavirus chaos. They don’t really heat up that well, but they are ideal for enforcing social segregation so you don’t get the big coof.⠀

Guo Fu Steamboat has been on my must try list for the longest time, and my gaaawwwddd it’s the perfect first post lockdown hotpot buffet. The lunch buffet is reasonable enough at $25.90++, and you get free flow EVERYTHING for two hours straight. Yes, even the xiao long baos. Of course, some things are far more worthy of your stomach’s real estate than others, and the special pork on the left & the premium beef on the right are undeniably worthy. Just look at the marbling, man. That’s decent quality right there.⠀
⠀
Unfortunately, the soup bases incur an additional charge, and my choice of the (Super) Male Vitality Soup was an extra seven bucks. Still, service is stellar for a hotpot place, and Guo Fu’s individual hotpots are certainly the new meta during this coronavirus chaos. They don’t really heat up that well, but they are ideal for enforcing social segregation so you don’t get the big coof.⠀

Enjoy tasty and affordable Japanese rice and noodles fare at this new and Halal-friendly eatery that is conveniently located near Bencoolen MRT Station.","Featured here is the Gyu-don which comprises a generous serving of savoury-sweet thin slices of US beef, onions and a wobbly onsen egg resting on a bed of pearly-white rice. The sauce that is drizzled over the Gyu-don is the same concoction that is used to simmer the tender beef slices for hours. Thus, the gravy is flavourful and rich with beefy essence.
The meals at Gyūnion are hearty and value for money and this is definitely a place worth checking out, especially if you are attending school or working in the Bencoolen area.

gyunion,"Gyumen
Besides their signature Gyumen, other options are available too like the Gyudon and a vegetarian (lacto ovo) option that is served with beancurd in place of the beef.","I was surprised how tasty the beancurd was and I really love the soft texture. A good alternative if you really wanna cut down on meat.

gyunion,Gyu Soba ($7.90): Just very happy that two of my favourite things plus an onsen tamago (additional $1 top up) are together in the same bowl at a relatively affordable price!,"If you missed my previous post, tldr their beef is legit cheap and good stuff. For this dish, the runny yolk actually didn't feel as shiok when spreading it over the soba vs spreading it over rice haha so maybe the onsen tamago top up isn't necessary haha

hokkaido-izakaya,For a Slurping Good Time,"Substantial and pretty economical, Hokkaido Izakaya’s compact lunch menu offers up a comforting selection of buckwheat noodles with FREE flow of onsen eggs, fried tempura batter and seaweed. Furthermore, you can upsize your soba with a choice of 100g, 200g, or 300g at no additional cost. Such a great deal! Having tried the Kakiage Tempura Soba (S$12) and Wagyu Beef Shabu Shabu Soba ($15), my favourite would definitely be the latter as the former does get a bit gelak after awhile.
Both set also came with onigiri which was a bit of an overkill on carbs but I managed to finish mine after soaking it in the broth. The generous slab of crisp mixed vegetables tempura perched on the bowl adds a nice texture though it does little to enhance the flavours to the dish whereas the thinly sliced beef complemented the warm savoury-sweet broth. The noodles of course, were pretty well done as well. Decent lunch option to satisfy any soba craving - TBH, they got me at free-flow soft boil eggs as each was perfectly done and super shiok when slurping with the soba.

Their Paitan is the hot favourite among us because it is light yet savoury enough. Well, this one-month old restaurant under Sushi Tei offers casual dining at affordable prices. This beef ramen is the most expensive item here, can you believe it? Located at Vivocity Level 2 beside Sushi Tei.

huiweibianmian88,👉 Signature Chilli Ban Mian👈,"Rated ⭐️⭐️⭐️ on @foodkingnoc, @huiweibanmian is a humble hawker stall at Geylang Bahru Food Centre that specialises in homemade ban mian. Offering both soup and dry versions, their Signature Chilli Ban Mian is the one that's highly recommended 👍.
。
After giving a good mix before digging in, what stood out most for me was the wonderful marriage of flavours, as well as their al dente handmade noodles. For those that can’t handle the spice well, I’ll suggest ordering it less spicy. That small scoop of chilli paste was really highly “effective”🙃.

We decided to get the well-rated gula melaka pandan cake to share and two large hot drinks. The total bill was $20. After trying this cake, I can understand why it’s been receiving great reviews from the Burpple community. The combination of pandan, topped with a layer of gula melaka, and dessicated coconut is a match made in heaven. The pandan cake wouldn’t make an impact on its own. It’s not fluffy enough to be a chiffon cake, it’s pretty dense, and just a decent pandan cake. Somehow the sweetness, and grainy texture of the gula melaka paste together with the coconut flakes, help to elevate the cake to the next level and make it truly outstanding.

The combination of pandan, topped with a layer of gula melaka, and dessicated coconut is a match made in heaven. The pandan cake wouldn’t make an impact on its own. It’s not fluffy enough to be a chiffon cake, it’s pretty dense, and just a decent pandan cake. Somehow the sweetness, and grainy texture of the gula melaka paste together with the coconut flakes, help to elevate the cake to the next level and make it truly outstanding.

Tastemaker Xing Wei Chua reveals that while he was attracted to this Jurong West stall for its glistening char siew, it was the Roast Duck (from $3.30) that wowed him. Sliced rather thinly along the grain, the duck ticks all the boxes with its tender, juicy and succulent meat. It's easy to bite through, and the skin offers a nice savoury dimension.

leong-ke-klang-bak-kut-teh,"The recent bak kut teh fiasco got me craving for some pork bone soup and after mostly eating the Teochew peppery version, I went onto Google and stumbled upon a blog post by @misstamchiak on a herbal bak kut teh, located at the heart of Geylang.","Probably one of the under-the-radar areas of Singapore for food, Geylang boasts quite a few popular eateries from handmade noodles to frog leg porridge, zichar and now the Malaysian style bak kut teh. If you have not tried this version yet, it is more towards the herbaceous side as you can see from the colour of the soup and the minute you sip on the broth, you can taste the depth of herbal notes. In addition to the pork ribs, you can find beancurd skin and vegetables in each claypot, which is almost a complete meal of its own. However, what stole the show (and our tastebuds) that evening would be the Dry Bak Kut Teh ($10), which we swop the pork ribs for chicken cuts and the meat is cooked in a rich and dark soya sauce, that comes bubbling in a claypot as well. As you dig through the treasure pot, you will find pieces of dried chilli, lady’s fingers and shredded dried cuttlefish, which contributed greatly to the umami-ness of the overall flavour. It can get too savoury at some point, hence, you must eat it with rice and balance it off with some of the herbal broth.

After all, Central is like my home ground since I go there all the time haha. As usual, being FOMO, I decided to patronise the restaurant on its Opening Day. Went late arnd 9pm and didn’t have to queue (yay!!). Between my parents and I, we ordered 2 portions to share (cos my mum is a small eater haha). We got the Kaisen x Hitsumabushi by Teppei and Man Man ($32.50) and the Large Hitsumabushi ($39.40 I think?). We enjoyed the meal, and both the sashimi cubes and unagi didn’t disappoint. I think the grilling of the unagi wasn’t completely consistent though, as I tried the unagi from both bowls and found that those in one bowl were significantly more charred than the other and a little tougher in texture. It wasn’t that big a problem to me though, as it was still nice enough to be enjoyable. Having the collaborative bowl actually solves the dilemma I have always had.

After all, Central is like my home ground since I go there all the time haha. As usual, being FOMO, I decided to patronise the restaurant on its Opening Day. Went late arnd 9pm and didn’t have to queue (yay!!). Between my parents and I, we ordered 2 portions to share (cos my mum is a small eater haha). We got the Kaisen x Hitsumabushi by Teppei and Man Man ($32.50) and the Large Hitsumabushi ($39.40 I think?). We enjoyed the meal, and both the sashimi cubes and unagi didn’t disappoint. I think the grilling of the unagi wasn’t completely consistent though, as I tried the unagi from both bowls and found that those in one bowl were significantly more charred than the other and a little tougher in texture.

My mum and I love unagi so we’ve been wanting to try Man Man. Chose to visit the Clarke Quay (The Central) outlet as I heard that there’s not as much crowd there - and it’s true! 
Tried the medium unagi donburi, which comes with unagi don, soup, appetizer (spinach), pickles. Very filling! 
The unagi don was really delicious - I love that the unagi was slightly charred and crispy and very flavourful! The fish was chewy with just the right amount of fat. 😋 The Japanese rice was, as usual, exceptional hehe. I always try to avoid eating too much carbs but I can never resist Japanese rice. 
The soup was actually really good too! Had not much expectations because it looks quite simple, but there were bits of yuzu peels in the soup which made the soup super refreshing! And I’m a huge fan of yuzu 🤩
The appetizer and pickles were nothing to shout about, but was a nice touch as it balances out the sweetness of the unagi.

Hainan Curry Rice for our mid-week lunch! Each plate is reasonable priced at $4/$5+ with lots of ingredients. There’s a wide variety of ingredients to choose from and some of our MUST ORDER dishes are Fried Pork Chop, Fried Prawn, Egg Floss, Cabbage and Pan-fried Long Beans! Egg floss was something unique and unusual in a Hainanese curry rice stall, it’s very light, fluffy and airy. Fried Pork chop were fried in small batches to ensure it’s crispiness and freshness when served. Their golden curry sauce is da bomb!! It’s absolutely delicious, with a lil sweet and savory, lil sticky and you can actually taste the fragrant curry spices in it! We love it when the aromatic curry covers the entire plate of white rice before they place the ingredients on top of it! If you order more curry, you may request for extra curry to go with it! Definitely the place to go to, to fix our Hainanese curry rice cravings! Satisfied and comforting at the same time👍🏼 .

Hainan Curry Rice for our mid-week lunch! Each plate is reasonable priced at $4/$5+ with lots of ingredients. There’s a wide variety of ingredients to choose from and some of our MUST ORDER dishes are Fried Pork Chop, Fried Prawn, Egg Floss, Cabbage and Pan-fried Long Beans! Egg floss was something unique and unusual in a Hainanese curry rice stall, it’s very light, fluffy and airy. Fried Pork chop were fried in small batches to ensure it’s crispiness and freshness when served. Their golden curry sauce is da bomb!! It’s absolutely delicious, with a lil sweet and savory, lil sticky and you can actually taste the fragrant curry spices in it! We love it when the aromatic curry covers the entire plate of white rice before they place the ingredients on top of it! If you order more curry, you may request for extra curry to go with it! Definitely the place to go to, to fix our Hainanese curry rice cravings! Satisfied and comforting at the same time👍🏼 .

Just received a saddening news... Our favourite Hainanese curry rice - Old Hainan will be ceasing operations from next Thursday, 31st October! 😢😭😢😭 .
.
On a brighter note, they will be relocating to a new location in December, stay tune.. From now till next Thurs, 31 October, they are open 9am-3pm everyday except Friday. So if you enjoys a mouth-watering plate of hainan curry rice like us, you should make a few more trips down to indulge before they close! We are so hooked to their crispy pork chop that’s fresh fried out from the frying pot, soft cabbage, and those delicious and amazing curry gravy that the white rice was fully soak in! .

Then the kids will surrounded the dinning table and started wrapping them. But this activity is getting lesser over these few years.
Popiah is a very simple dish. Mainly assemble with the parts b/m.
1. The skin - the owner hand made every skin. He will grab a ball of very thick batter and spread a thin layer on to the hot plate. Fried it for less than 2mins. If the skin got too thick, the popiah will taste very heavy. If too thin, it can't contain the juicy turnip.
2. Stir fried Turnip - the uncle told me that frying turnip required patient. It must be fried till it's color turn light brownish as it's starch started to caramelize. Then it's sweetness could be portray out fully.
3. Crispy Golden Bits.
The crispy bits provided an savory sweet flavor which was so comforting to the mouth.
4. Unforgettable chili.

This is my second time at Old Street and my impression of it improved by leaps and bounds. Aside from the much richer BKT broth, what I enjoyed even more was the fast and rather polite service. Our food came within 5 minutes of our order and all our food items were hot. We came for the Set A ($11.10) which comes with a bowl of BKT soup (normal ribs), 1 basket of Youtiao, 1 bowl of rice and 1 bowl of beancurd (not pictured). While this is very affordable, I highly recommend to order only one set and simply add on another bowl of soup if you are coming in a party of 2.

We came for the Set A ($11.10) which comes with a bowl of BKT soup (normal ribs), 1 basket of Youtiao, 1 bowl of rice and 1 bowl of beancurd (not pictured). While this is very affordable, I highly recommend to order only one set and simply add on another bowl of soup if you are coming in a party of 2. Each set comes with too much carbo, which left the man and I too full after the meal. Also, add a bowl of preserved vegetables (mei cai) on the side.

The thick chunky slice of chashu may be a little porky for some, but had a good bite and a sweet tasting marination. The thin noodles though, could do with more springiness especially as it ends up softer nearing the end. Other toppings in here include Japanese fishcake, bamboo shoots, leek, seaweed and a really well done oozy ajitama egg. Thumbs up too for the broth that managed to be kept warm throughout the meal till the very last drop. At this price, you also get free flow hard boiled eggs and radish. Very affordable for the portion and standard!",Wei Zhi Chiang,@cweizhi,price,last drop,0,,

oven-marvel-at-sushine-plaza,Here’s a little secret I’m sharing with you on the foodie haven happening inside the nondescript Sunshine Plaza.,"Besides the many printing shops and dim sum place that this place is known for, there’s actually several hidden gems that’s changing the landscape of this place. Recommended by @gladysng_27, there’s two pit stops that you have to make when here, one a little Japanese eatery and another a bakery wizardry. Located at the centre of the first level, they are located a few units away from each other and you will most probably miss it if you didn’t look closely as there’s no fanciful decoration both inside and out. However, if there’s one thing that you can rely on, it’s definitely your sense of smell. My first stop is to Ichi Tei and there was no denying me from getting the Saba Set ($10), which was absolutely a steal and value-for-money set as you get a huge piece of grilled saba that has been spiced with shio, miso soup, Japanese rice and a side salad. The star of the show is undeniably the saba as it was grilled perfectly and with a squeeze of lemon, it elevated the dish and gives life to it, with the right balance of tangy and savoury while the meat cooked to the right texture. Next up, it’s to Oven Marvel, which is a homemade bakery that’s so discreet that you wouldn’t know how popular they are. Specialising in only chicken pies, muffins and curry puffs, most stuff are baked to order and usually gets sold out very quickly. Based on the few minutes that I was there, there were several people who went in, got their pre-ordered items that are packed in boxes and left, which is a testament to their popularity. Even their countertop don’t have much bakes left on sale, however we were fortunately to sample their curry puff ($2.80), which was filled with generous portions of potato cubes and chicken meat, encased in a wonderful buttery pastry.

Recommended by @gladysng_27, there’s two pit stops that you have to make when here, one a little Japanese eatery and another a bakery wizardry. Located at the centre of the first level, they are located a few units away from each other and you will most probably miss it if you didn’t look closely as there’s no fanciful decoration both inside and out. However, if there’s one thing that you can rely on, it’s definitely your sense of smell. My first stop is to Ichi Tei and there was no denying me from getting the Saba Set ($10), which was absolutely a steal and value-for-money set as you get a huge piece of grilled saba that has been spiced with shio, miso soup, Japanese rice and a side salad. The star of the show is undeniably the saba as it was grilled perfectly and with a squeeze of lemon, it elevated the dish and gives life to it, with the right balance of tangy and savoury while the meat cooked to the right texture. Next up, it’s to Oven Marvel, which is a homemade bakery that’s so discreet that you wouldn’t know how popular they are. Specialising in only chicken pies, muffins and curry puffs, most stuff are baked to order and usually gets sold out very quickly. Based on the few minutes that I was there, there were several people who went in, got their pre-ordered items that are packed in boxes and left, which is a testament to their popularity. Even their countertop don’t have much bakes left on sale, however we were fortunately to sample their curry puff ($2.80), which was filled with generous portions of potato cubes and chicken meat, encased in a wonderful buttery pastry.

oven-marvel-at-sushine-plaza,Best $4 I've ever spent on a pie.,"Tucked away in Sunshine Plaza, Oven Marvel is a cozy bakery started by ex-Hilton Hotel pastry chef, Chef Johnny Ngiam. The puff pastry is buttery and flaky, and has a beautiful aroma. The pastry balance is just right, buttery but not too oily, yet not dry. You'll find chunks of chicken and unshrivelled peas in a peppery, creamy mashed potato filling, complementing the pastry in the most wonderful way. This is the kind of pie that reminisces bakeries in the hood back in the days. What a great savoury snack to have at any time!

This is only $5! I should have turned the chicken over to show that it's the breast plus wing. This is how it was served, so I let it be. Slurp!! A note of caution : beware of the cardamom!

pepper-lunch-at-jems,| Pepper Lunch ペッパーランチPepper Lunch is a very popular restaurant chain from Japan that specializes in serving up food that sizzles in piping hot metal plates.,"In Singapore, there are 7 Pepper Lunch restaurants and 32 Pepper Lunch Express which can be found at the food courts in shopping malls.
We visited the branch at JEM, Jurong East. The place was nice and cozy and quite packed during dinner time. We ordered a Teriyaki Chicken with Egg, a Chicken Curry Cheesy Risotto and a bowl of Mashed Potato.
The Mashed Potato was smooth and the gravy on top was neither too salty nor oily. However, we felt that it was not as good as the one at the Jurong Point Branch.
The Teriyaki Chicken with Egg is the safe option as we had tried it several times. Mixing it with an adequate amount of Honey Brown Sauce and Garlic Soy Sauce and we got a hot plate of pure goodness!
The Chicken Curry Cheesy Risotto was fantastic as well and the highlight was probably watching the cheese melt on the rice and seeing how high it could stretch when we pulled it.
What is your favourite dish at Pepper Lunch?
Note: Do take your photos of the dish quickly as the rice and meat may get charred if you do not stir it fast!

pepper-lunch-at-jems,| Pepper Lunch ペッパーランチPepper Lunch is a very popular restaurant chain from Japan that specializes in serving up food that sizzles in piping hot metal plates.,"In Singapore, there are 7 Pepper Lunch restaurants and 32 Pepper Lunch Express which can be found at the food courts in shopping malls.
We visited the branch at JEM, Jurong East. The place was nice and cozy and quite packed during dinner time. We ordered a Teriyaki Chicken with Egg, a Chicken Curry Cheesy Risotto and a bowl of Mashed Potato.
The Mashed Potato was smooth and the gravy on top was neither too salty nor oily. However, we felt that it was not as good as the one at the Jurong Point Branch.
The Teriyaki Chicken with Egg is the safe option as we had tried it several times. Mixing it with an adequate amount of Honey Brown Sauce and Garlic Soy Sauce and we got a hot plate of pure goodness!
The Chicken Curry Cheesy Risotto was fantastic as well and the highlight was probably watching the cheese melt on the rice and seeing how high it could stretch when we pulled it.
What is your favourite dish at Pepper Lunch?
Note: Do take your photos of the dish quickly as the rice and meat may get charred if you do not stir it fast!

Teriyaki Chicken with Egg: $11.90
Chicken Curry Cheesy Risotto: $12.90
Mashed Potato: $2.80
